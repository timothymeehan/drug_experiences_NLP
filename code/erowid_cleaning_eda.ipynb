       "      <td>\\nFresh from my second experience with LSD and still beaming with the afterglow, I find myself back in the real world of work and taxes and congested transit lines once more. The Australian bush, serene and simple, is an ideal place to trip on this beautiful substance, and I wish I could have stayed forever. But there will be another time, already eagerly awaited, to share this experience again with wonderful friends who understand exactly the joy and wonder of opening your mind to the beauty of natural creation.\\r\\n\\nWhat can I call this trip but my final inauguration into the world of psychedelics? Ive had a rocky start on this journey, bad trips and major let-downs that have filled my mind with doubt and anxiety. Now I feel LSD has taught me the fundamental rules of psychonautics, the same lessons more experienced psychonauts have tried to instil in me, only this time, the sheer power of those hours under the night sky broke through my stubborn expectations and showed me. As they say: life-changing.\\r\\n\\nFirst, a little background. I started out with dextromethorphan, but discontinued after a third plateau trip that left me feeling like a broken soul who didnt really exist. I then moved on to mushrooms, starting with a two gram trip of a potent species, and it all went well enough until I encountered something so horrific, it shattered my resolve to use hallucinogens as tools for self-discovery, and had me traumatised for a week. In the wake of the four worst hours of my life, I spent the next two months piecing together just what had gone so, so wrong. Did I have some neurological disorder that prevents me from having an experience that isnt an acute psychotic episode? If I continued dabbling with these substances, would I lose my mind for good? If not for my desperate need for answers, I would have walked away at that point, and I often felt a wiser person would have done just that.\\r\\n\\nBear with me as I describe this nightmare of a bad trip. Imagine yourself walking about, ruminating on ever more confused and less sane philosophy about being God, when suddenly, all your senses warp into a confused mess. Everything you see, hear and feel no longer makes the slightest sense, as your room transforms into a mesh of colours and you lose the ability to distinguish sound and touch from emotion and thought. It is to find yourself catapulted out of this human existence into some other place where nothing is solid, there is no time, sanity dissolves, and amid the absolute disorientation there is only one clear thought: Oh. Fuck.\\r\\n\\nI have just fucked up my life.\\r\\n\\nIts impossible to say how long this lasted, perhaps a minute, perhaps an hour. The only awareness I had of the outside world was that it must still be there, and that my friends and family must be so horrified that I destroyed my mind on drugs. As it began to clear, and the connections between percept and concept re-established, I looked around the room with only slightly less confusion. What was this place, who was I, what was I? I had no idea. I spent the rest of the trip gradually working through the confusion to find myself again. I awoke next morning to severe depression and a conviction that I would never, ever touch drugs again.\\r\\n\\nThe night had been so confusing that it was only when I took acid two months later that I remembered this disconnect between my perceptions and my ability to interpret, the dissolution of boundary between thought and senses. All I had was vague memories of a hellish experience that felt like serious brain damage. But acid has a unique way of enhancing my imagination, and now that I understand just what happened, Ive come to know it as the Blur.\\r\\n\\nI tried san pedro, only to find the specimen was inactive. I tried weed for the first time at four hits, and it triggered a minor flashback of the Blur, which I no better understood, but it left me feeling that continuing hallucinogen use would be a sure one-way ticket to that psychotic state. But at the urging of experienced psychonauts, I gave it one more shot and dropped half a tab of acid. The result was a beautiful night of euphoria and clear-headedness Ive never known before, a brilliant mental stimulant for an introspective mind. I still harboured anxiety that a full tab might tip me over the edge, but resolved to try it anyway.\\r\\n\\nNow, set and setting. I drove several hours out of the city with two friends, M and G, to a campsite where wed spend the next three days. It was M, a tripper seasoned with four decades of substance use, much of it at this very site, who supplied the acid. G, who sampled ecstasy and was currently enjoying pot every day, only had one psychedelic experience to his name, and it was on LSD some six years earlier. Hed taken two tabs and ended up in a mental ward for the next few months. G is the most genuinely happy and accepting person Ive ever had the pleasure of knowing, and as an enthusiast of consciousness study, he felt ready to give it another try with good company and a beautiful environment. So it was that we set up camp, spent Friday acquainting ourselves with the sunlit groves and acacia fields, the crystalline river and the tens of thousands of datura plants lining its bank. By Saturday, I felt relaxed and peaceful, and ready to plunge into my first full-blown, not-horrible, psychedelic experience.\\r\\n\\nWe dropped the tabs at 3p.m. on Saturday. M felt it would be best to start late afternoon, as the night ambience and starlight is beautiful on acid. We both took one tab, while G took a half. Theres no way to be sure, but I estimate their strength at 80µg, and though Im interested in heavy experiences down the road, I dont see myself ever taking this particular substance at more than 120µg, nor using it more than once a year. Beautiful though it was, I also think I may be one of those rare people who appreciates low-dose acid, perhaps in conjunction with another substance, for its unobtrusive consciousness expansion and creative mindset. On this night, though, the one tab was perfect.\\r\\n\\nAs we started feeling the effects, we left the campsite and took a walk off-road into the sunburnt gullies and the hills abundant with kangaroos. Some describe the acid come-up as hard and pushy, but I think its wonderful. I soon had a big smile on my face and not a care in the world. The LSD was tweaking my consciousness and we were laughing at the stupidest things, yet my thoughts became crisp, unburdened. And then less than an hour in, something happened that almost derailed the experience.\\r\\n\\nI was looking at the dirt as I walked... and I had an experiential flash of another state of mind that made me think... What if, as Im walking along, everything I see, hear, taste and smell, and all of my thoughts and feelings, blur into a total incoherent mesh? ... Oh, shit. Thats exactly what happened on shrooms, isnt it.\\r\\n\\nIn an instant, my euphoria was gone. I was starting to get very worried. LSD truly gives me amazing imaginative power, and I couldnt help but imagine exactly what it would be like if the Blur struck right then. It would propel me into a state of total schizophrenia. I would be walking alongside my friends and reality would just disintegrate, and that would be the end. I might never recover. I might be trapped in that other world, that horrible Blur, forever. And thats the price I pay for taking too much LSD  those people who encouraged me to go for it were wrong, this really is going to destroy my mind.\\r\\n\\nI was shaken. Simply by imagining it, I seemed to be invoking the fucking thing, just by the sheer vivid power of my imagination.\\r\\n\\nMy friends knew my history. I could never in good conscience trip with people and not tell them Id had less than stellar experiences with psychedelics. But I kept my mouth shut and resolved to get through this alone. If I told them something was wrong, their carefree air might turn to concern, and that would only make things worse. Besides, if the Blur was going to happen, it would happen, there was no stopping it. I knew I was wavering on the edge of another bad trip just by inviting that doubt into my mind, so I gritted my teeth, anchored myself in reality, and resolved to endure my own anxiety. Acid is such a powerful substance; it only takes one wrong thought pattern to make it all go to hell. I knew this, and Id learnt enough from my previous bad trips to not fall for the tricks my mind was playing on me. So there I was, in limbo between good trip and bad, wrestling to keep it together. Had I taken more, I probably wouldnt have been able.\\r\\n\\nThe sun was almost setting as we made our way back to camp. My main concern by now was whether I actually had any control over whether the trip went well or not. After all, I pondered, how does this work, exactly? People take acid with good set and setting, and sometimes it goes wrong anyway  is that a random chemical fluctuation, or do they just give in to scary thoughts like the ones Im having? Am I in control here? I parted from M and G, who I later found out were wrestling their own demons, and laid down in the grass to focus my attention on the river and calm down.\\r\\n\\nThis was where I got my first visuals. The cliff face across the water began to morph. The longer I stared at it, the more it twisted. It was a subtle, slow process, and as soon as I looked away, it became solid again. I looked up at the trees above the cliff face, and the entire hillside they rested on started bending, so it looked like the landscape was bowing to me. Quite different from mushroom visuals, which are more electrical and remind me of Alex Greys artwork. What they share in common is that the transformation goes deeper the more you stare at the object.\\r\\n\\nI remained nervous and my anxiety seemed to permeate the air, like a presence in the valley. For the next while, I felt that whatever I was doing, I really ought to be doing something else to get a grip, before this anxiety became the dark and terrifying presence of a bad LSD trip. I thought chatting with my friends might work, but found it stressful to keep a happy composure around them. I found being too far away from them didnt help either, because Id be on my own and might get lost if things went bad. Youd think the middle ground of being in their vicinity would work, but it didnt. So what saved me? Laughter.\\r\\n\\nI was sitting in the caravan, trying to write down trip notes. G was saying how impressed he was that I could write anything at all, because he, on half a tab, couldnt manage more than one word. (Incidentally, everything I wrote was quite coherent and legible, but I soon gave up because there was too much happening and writing by hand is sooo slooow on acid.) Anyway, I was having trouble concentrating on what he was saying, so at one point I nodded and said, Mm... thats right... Excuse me. I need to go outside and watch some rocks morph.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the next five minutes laughing hysterically. The rest of the trip was awesome.\\r\\n\\nIt was far from the last funny thing that happened  indeed, our conversations became a strange mix of philosophy, rating burps out of ten, and the most profound fart humour possible... more philosophy, and puns so bad we had to laugh, or occasionally so great we... had to laugh. I was doing most of the philosophy, and I felt an overwhelming need to share it. LSD is very expressive, for me. On the half tab the week before, Id written seventeen pages of things I felt needed to be said, in three hours. Here, I was saying things like, Solipsism can be practical. Embrace self-centredness, but dont let it absorb you. G thought this was brilliant, and insisted I return to the caravan and write down every such thing I said. Every experience I have, with all the existential subtleties, the nuances of feeling  all of it is so unique and how else could I, God, experience it, than to not know I am immortal? M was there to bring us back to reality, and we spent as much time taking the piss out of ourselves as we did legitimately pontificating, until the two merged into one and I announced: The real Zen master knows that Zen is bullshit.\\r\\n\\nYes, acid is a very thinking drug, and I return to what I said before about low doses. Thirty or forty milligrams would be ideal if you need a lateral solution to a problem.\\r\\n\\nPeriodically, I left the fire wed built to stand alone under the stars. Here, I became melancholy. I thought about my problems, the chronic dissociation in my life that makes it impossible to even want to be part of human civilization. I felt bitter that LSD wasnt helping me find a way to heal that, as Id hoped it might. I thought about death and non-existence, what an incredible waste it is, and how stupid it is that were supposed to find any consolation in one day not experiencing reality. Fuck you, I said to the beautiful face of the Goddess that formed in the sky. She was there everywhere I looked, a serene face of many forms composed of the million stars in the clear night sky. I gave her the finger.\\r\\n\\nLater, I wandered about and reflected on my bad mushroom trip, and how Id felt close to slipping back into it before. What had that all been about? It was the Blur, I realised. At last I could remember just what had happened, how my brain had stopped making sense of my every perception and, not being in any way prepared for it, Id panicked. That trip didnt necessarily have to be a bad one. I just didnt have the experience to handle it. And the reason Id spent the rest of it having a psychotic episode wherein I alternately believed I was God, a patient in a mental hospital, a prisoner in my room for eternity, etc. was because I had no idea what to do with something like that. It had completely thrown me. Theres a knack to this tripping thing, thats why more experienced users can take high-dose DMT and hold it together. \\r\\n\\nWhat was it theyd told me? Whatever happens, dont fight it, you have to ride it out. Id had trouble believing that before. Surely if you dont fight the real psychotic thoughts, thats when you break down and end up in a mental ward, like my friend G on his first time. But now it made sense. Even the ones who do lose it, theyre not still tripping when theyre in hospital. Theyre just insane. There was no danger of the Blur ever lasting for my entire life; I would always come down from it, and the only way lasting damage could occur would be if, indeed, I resisted it, and believed I was losing my mind. Because that is traumatic, and a powerful enough blast of it would be enough to unhinge anyone, the same way watching your lover get tortured, raped and murdered would be enough to send someone over the edge.\\r\\n\\nTherefore, the solution was always to ride it out, and have an anchor. If I find my ego blasted to the four corners of reality, I need only hold on to one thing: This is a trip. It is not real. It will pass. And I could have done that, even during the Blur. But I gave in to the fear that Id just lost my mind for good, which was exactly how it felt, and it had destroyed me.\\r\\n\\nStill, a doubt lingered. How could I be sure about this? And then, I had my answer.\\r\\n\\nI went back to the fireplace, and asked M and G to give me some weed.\\r\\n\\nJust one hit, I said, and explained what I was trying to do. Last time I smoked, it had invoked the Blur in a mild shroom flashback. At the time, I had interpreted it as psychosis. It hadnt been as intense as the full thing, but it was still scary and highly uncomfortable, so I decided never to smoke pot again  basically, I decided to run away from the problem. Now, I was turning volte-face and confronting it. This would be my test. My initiation into the world of tripping. And if I was wrong, I would probably lose my mind.\\r\\n\\nI took a good deep hit, laid back to watch the fire, and waited.\\r\\n\\nMarijuana and acid have wonderful synergy. You feel heavy and incredibly relaxed, yet far from incapacitated. Conversations drift off in a hundred tangents, yet you always come back to what you started with and you never forget what you were saying. The dynamic of our little group was simply perfect, three misfits of varying ages figuring out the meaning of life in our own ways, feeling wed glimpsed enlightenment. It was incredible. Im a lightweight with weed, and the acid seemed to potentiate it, so pretty soon, I was pleasantly stoned. And then, just like I predicted, the Blur crept into the fabric of my consciousness about an hour in.\\r\\n\\nAt first, it was very subtle. I noticed some confusion about the tea I was drinking, how the sensation of warm liquid going down my throat didnt seem to make sense. How could it be happening in space and time when it was just a sensation? Sensations dont have dimension. (Perhaps youve experienced something similar on drugs; if not, you probably wont be able to follow.) Gradually it intensified. Our campfire conversation became a far-away mesh of meaningless percept. Yet I held fast to my goal. I did not panic. Whenever I felt Id gone too far out, I reminded myself I was tripping, and endured it. The dissociation from self and identity, the blurring of the line between thought and the external world, sunk into my consciousness. But the warm glow of acid helped me through it. Everything felt right, even the atemporal, non-spatial stomach cramps I was having. All in all, on Blur scale, it reached a three or a four out of ten, and I was still able to hold conversation despite the powerful dissociation. My last experience on weed might make a five on that scale, and on mushrooms, where everything got obliterated, a ten. I didnt need a five or a ten. This preview of it was enough to know that next time I encounter it, Ill be ready.\\r\\n\\nAnd the weed slowly wore off, and we started coming down from the acid.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the rest of the night until 3a.m. playing music from the caravan, and eating campfire food and chocolate. Music on LSD is not as good as on DXM and definitely not as good as mushrooms, but it still gels with the everything-is-just-right glow of acid. Food, however, is transcendentally awesome. Fruit explodes in your mouth. The texture of dark chocolate cracking apart into sweet chunks, the salty potatoes disintegrating on your tongue with hot butter, the onion and (non-psychedelic) mushrooms rich with oil... perfect. We shared previous experiences on drugs  G insisted I write down my description of DXM: Feeling like youve lost 30 IQ points, and good riddance. We stood under the stars again, and this time the Goddess turned into a vampire goth chick, and we all spotted geometric connections between the brighter stars. Visuals had mostly passed by this point, but we continued to notice how the stars looked like little lanterns hanging a few hundred metres overhead instead of thousands of light years away, and how the tin foil around the potatoes looked like breath-taking crystal skulls, or the heads of a Terminator or Optimus Prime. Finally, M fell asleep, and me and G retired to our tent.\\r\\n\\nUnfortunately, I found it impossible to sleep, and spent the next hour tossing and turning. I was getting faint closed-eye visuals, much like what I picture from a very weak hit of DMT. At first they were slow-moving geometric patterns and shapes, morphing smoothly in dreamlike fashion. But as I got more frustrated, they turned into rotten teeth and hideous dinosaur skeletons. Eventually, I realised that with my last, half-tab experience on acid, what Id interpreted as a hangover had in fact been the trip continuing. That day, Id remained dissociated even the next night at work, and I was still having trippy thoughts and a generally altered perception. This time, Id taken more, so it was stronger. My conclusion: for some reason, I peak normally, but I continue tripping for a long time on acid, perhaps about thirty hours. It was impossible to sleep while tripping, so I woke M up and asked for some Valium. It knocked me out mid-sentence in conversation with G.\\r\\n\\nThe next day was glorious. We wandered the national park and I was in love with everything. All so warm and colourful and orgasmic! I felt proud of my decision to face the Blur and my victory over it, and I was looking ahead to my future psychedelic experiences. I think I will try san pedro next, and then ayahuasca and DMT, if I feel up to the incredible mind-fuck. This had been my best trip so far and certainly I took a lot away from it. I have an enhanced appreciation of life, even though I still struggle with what seems to be a mild form of derealisation disorder, and I have hope now that with the help of psychedelic drugs, Ill one day find the answers Im so desperately looking for. Psychonautics is a legitimate psychospiritual discipline for those who want to use drugs that way, and hopefully one day, society will recognise that. A legitimate path for those who seek self-discovery. Trip on and may you all find the peace I had when I sat before that fire and glimpsed, just for a few hours, perfect contentment.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nFirst, a little background. I am not your typical psychonaut, well, at least not stereotypical. I am a high technology major in University; Id like to consider myself relatively well adjusted, and relatively safe in most of my endeavors. Prior to this experience, I had done no other drug other than ganja, I found the concept of psychoactive substances frightening, and didn't consider myself ready for the experience.\\r\\n\\nThis past summer, a good friend who I had lived with in a Dorm that year contacted me about going to a rave, a music festival really. On a sparsely populated island legendary in the area for the open-minded populace, and frequent drug use. I agreed to go, as did three of my other good friends.\\r\\n\\nWe went to this festival, a three day affair, the previous week I had been preparing myself for it, reading all I possibly could about LSD. Bolstered by my newfound knowledge, I arrived to the event, and set up camp. Being as that this was a three day affair, we agreed that we should plan our trip. That night we partied, enjoyed the good music, didnt really sleep, but had a good time. The next morning, we all awoke and started to make preparations, we agreed to eat these little sugar cubes a friend had acquired, liquid locally produced, pack a bag with supplies, and then set off down the beach. We ate the sugar cubes, all joked nervously, packed a bag with water, pot, and a camera and set out. There were four of us, only one had tripped before, we really had no idea what we were in for.\\r\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, the rocks started to sparkle. We where walking down the beach, enjoying the beautiful weather, when we started to point out the beauty of the stones, their place, their job, their perfection. At this point, we knew it was starting to kick in.\\r\\n\\nTripping steadily, we ducked into the forest, a likely sheltered wooded path providing the perfect venue in which to experience our newfound expanded perception. I felt truly alive, I had embarked on this trip to try to find something I didnt know I was missing, it quickly became evident that my truth was lying just beyond the horizon.\\r\\n\\nThe forest was beautiful, more beautiful than anything Ive ever seen before in my life. Plants were not just plants... they where an extension of the planets beauty. Bees buzzed with a purpose, not simply diving and weaving aimlessly, but traveling with duty. Realizing most of the plants around us actually stinging nettle (think poison ivy",
       " but Canadian) we returned to the beach, rounding the corner to possibly the most confusing situation we could have.\\r\\n\\nThere stood, on the beach, a cabin. Keep in mind, this is NOT a city. This is a beach that requires 20 minutes of off-road travel to simply reach, electricity ending 30 or 40 kilometers back up the island. And here lies a cabin. Approaching the building warily, I felt like we werent ready for it. Like it was not our place, it was not the right time for this building, however, we entered cautiously. The cabin was furnished, not only with the standard couches, but a television, vcr, and stack of movies, quickly becoming apparent that a generator was required for full operation. Relics of past trips lie all around us. Here a picture, there a stack of beer cans, carved in the wood of the walls lie the reminders of previous adventures. Walking over to a side table, I picked up a curious scrap of paper, yellowed with time, it read:\\r\\n\\nWould you rather step in quicksand?\\r\\nOr spend your entire life\\r\\nAvoiding it\\r\\n\\nThis rang deep. Deeper than three lines should, looking at each other in wonder, we decided that we needed to keep moving. The empty place seemed too large for us, seemed too hard to comprehend. Hoisting our bag of tricks high, we left, staring back at the tiny house, wondering what other secrets it held.\\r\\n\\nBy this time, in the hot sun, we had finished two bottles of water, having no pockets due to shorts; I tied the empty containers to the corners of a bright green bandanna, letting it hang from a belt loop. Suddenly I felt the need to complete it, picking up a stone; I tied a third corner off, a bright red lighter completing the fourth. Holding my creation aloft I placed it upon my friends head, and there he stood dubbed: Captain Acid Hat.\\r\\n\\nOnward Captain Acid Hat and his band ventured, walking down the pristine beach, leaping from rock to rock, enjoying the experience of having our senses unleashed.\\r\\n\\nHere we diverge from pure narrative and into theory. When experiencing such emotions, I pondered, what could possibly cause such a shift in reality? Was Captain Acid Hats amazing adventure simply fantasy? Were we all experiencing random synapses firing that caused the plants to seem so alive, the bees to seem so committed, and the water to sparkle like the light of a thousand suns? Or was it something else, deeper.\\r\\n\\nSpiritual? Unlikely. I am a man of technology, I entertain few delusions of theology, in fact, one of my greatest fears was the possibility of experiencing a spiritual vision, what if Im wrong? What if Im faced with the reality of a Christian theology? How would I deal with my entire worldview being shattered? No, this was more. Spirituality was minor in the world I experienced, where there a god he would be humbled by the beauty present in everyday things.\\r\\n\\nMy theory is this: To assume and assert that our five senses represent the culmination of the universes experience is not only arrogant, but dead wrong. It has frequently been suggested by far smarter men than I that we exist in a tiny bubble of reality, our brains are wired through evolution to handle only so much input, so much feeling. But we take it all in, our eyes see everything, our eyes see radio waves, our eyes see other crossing dimensions, our eyes take in everything that exists, but our brain filters it out.\\r\\n\\nLSD is not a harsh chemical, it is not a brutal taskmaster, forcing me into an altered state of consciousness, its a switch, flicking it opened my mind, and I believe, reduces the filters placed between me and reality. For the first time, when I looked at those sparking rocks, I saw them for what they were, without the muddling filters of my brain blocking it.\\r\\n\\nBut back to the story.\\r\\n\\nRounding another bend, we spied the end of our journey. The beach ended, curved up into a rocky bluff, impossible to climb in our state, but affording an amazing vantage point, shaded as it was by the thick tree cover on the hill. We made camp, opened our bag of tricks, and started to talk. About everything, about life, about our experience, we related it quite strongly to simply being stoned out of our gourds, the lot of us surprised at how gentle it was. Our minds were not addled nor chained, we could think, we could talk, hell, Im sure that given the right motivation we could dance, had we not other, more important things on our minds.\\r\\n\\nPacking a bowl took an hour and a half, but we didnt notice, the slow process of grinding passed between us all, rotating seemingly in an organized pattern. Three members of the group would engage in deep discussion while the fourth would be off on their own, watching the water, or the trees, or the rocks, or the weed, never really becoming detached, simply orbiting, it reminded me a lot of a solar system.\\r\\n\\nWe discussed the note from the cabin, its significance, possible theories for its meaning and the place it was found in. We evolved, we became stronger, and on that beach, sitting in the shade, staring and trying to comprehend a tugboat moving across the strait, I found what I was looking for, the missing piece to my life. To a stranger it is unexplainable, but rest assured, I needed to find it.\\r\\n\\nThe sun rose in the sky, becoming mighty at its zenith, and started to descend as the afternoon wore on. Our shade retreated, becoming brighter and brighter, until our cool perch became hot. We decided it was time to head back to the camp. Walking back to the cabin, I noticed the only downside to the entire weekend, in my eagerness to set out, I had forgotten to apply sunscreen to my left arm, the skin was bright red and obviously sunburned. I took captain acid hat back, drenched it in seawater, and placed it over my arm, tying it tight and keeping the sun off it.\\r\\n\\nWe once again reached the cabin. But now it was different, it wasnt hostile, it was inviting. It had judged us, and finding us worthy, became a happy place to be. It became our cabin, our place of refuge from the sun, we explored it, laughed at its jokes, its quirks, doubling up in hilarity as we discovered the foil packets arranged on the table contained dried magic mushrooms, we left them, had no need of them.\\r\\n\\nWe packed a bowl, and then I stood, looking over to the tv that couldnt possibly turn on, spying a drawing on top of it. It was beautiful, simply patterns in crayon, and on the back. Tripping in the cabin, lots of love, john and Marcy, new years 2006. I realized we needed to leave our mark, looking back at my friends, laughing on the old dusty couch, it came to me:\\r\\n\\nYou will never know what youre seeking\\r\\nUntil you find it.\\r\\n\\n-July 2008\\r\\n\\nPlacing the note down, we smoked a bowl and decided to set back, braving the unforgiving sun once again to arrive home, the music of the stage reached us first, bounced over the water, and we started to see tents again, people. Interacting with humans again was peculiar, I felt enlightened, strengthened.\\r\\n\\nWe discovered (much to our delight) that the beach we tred upon was actually a nude beach, and the tanned flesh of dozens of beauties lounged about, smiling to ourselves we made our way back to our campsite, to bottles of water, and the end to a wonderful experience.\\r\\n\\nLSD Changed my life. It wasnt huge, I didnt drop my major and live in the forest, nor did I freak out and swear it off forever, I simply realized how Id been going about things wrong. I am a changed man due to this wonderful chemical, and a stronger human being from that beach.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nTo say that I have tasted the purity of reason is an understatement. The human mind is certainly a beautiful product of evolution. The world is full of amazing processes and cycles, and to even begin to understand some of these is an incredible experience, one which will surely change my life forever. Like many people before me, I have always been intrigued by the subconscious, that which is the very fabric of our dreams, that which explains our actions to an extreme amount of detail, and of course that which frees us from the everyday worries that we are faced with in this society. And whatever actions I chose to take in the past, it all culminated to a single day, which will forever be imprinted in my head as 'the best goddamn day of my life'.\\r\\n\\nIt all started one day, when a friend tells me that he is able to obtain a vial containing liquid d-lysergic acid diethylamide or 'LSD'. This was joyous to me, simply because LSD had provided me with amazing and fun experiences in the past, and this time it could be repeated with LSD in a form that was both pure and potent. Needless to say a few friends and I purchased a bottle, and we each took a total of four drops of this mystical substance.\\r\\n\\nI was not new to psychedelics at this stage of my life, having dabbled in Mushrooms, LSD, Salvia Divinorum and Morning Glory seeds. So it was surprising for me that I had difficulty at the beginning of this voyage in that I did not have any hold over the experience.  This was by far the highest dose of LSD (considering how diluted earlier doses were, in comparison) I have ever taken, and that was quite evident in the initial body load. We made the decision to go somewhere out in nature, after having noticed the amazing visual changes that come with an acid trip in the home we had dropped it in.  Seeing nature has proven to be very successful at 'saving' the experience in the past. Sure enough, we were still uncomfortably vulnerable to everything around us, but somehow we found solace in our own thoughts. We began debating about various topics, such as what it meant to be human, what it meant to think, and what everything else meant to us. We were surely an odd looking group of people walking in strange ways around a church playground, but this did not bother us all that much.  Near dusk, we sat on a curb, as we talked about life. At this point, everything I knew about the 'self' began to dissolve.  Slowly but surely, our egos melded into the immense cosmic energy that enveloped us.\\r\\n\\nThe sunset came right as the dissolution of our egos was completed. A spectacle of color blending into air, and air blending into color. Never before had I seen something so moving, so inspiring, so true. I could nearly taste the colors in the sky, needless to say I truly understood The Beatles when they sang about 'marmalade skies'. It felt as if we had been under the influence of the substance for days, however it was only six in the afternoon, and had only been four hours since we noticed the initial effects of the drug. All of these overwhelming emotions of abiding joy and happiness indicated that we were getting into a lot more than we bargained for, and we were about to find why.\\r\\n\\nThe confusing reactions of the people around us eventually became nothing more than a cue for us to leave said playground. The walk back to the house was surely a fast one, since I have little recollection of it, surely it was unimportant compared to other events that happened that day. We arrived and we put on some music and relaxed, still talking about the miracle we had witnessed. At this point it was as if all of our egos were combined into a cloud of consciousness that rested directly on top of us. A person in the group could say something, and that thought would be completely understood by everybody in the group. One could say just one word and everyone would be able to follow a slew of topics and intents behind it.\\r\\n\\nWe had been thinking and talking the whole time, debating some of life's greatest mysteries. The house had been painted an intense orange color and the majority of the objects in the bathroom had the same intense color to them. This covered everything and everybody in ever-flowing hues of orange. The air in the room seemed liquid, I could move my hand and it would ripple out the image behind it, leaving trails of my hand in the air. There was about three or four moths inside the room, and their flight patterns were quite evident with the semi-viscous liquid properties the room had taken. They seemed to fly in predictable patterns, that of sine and cosine waves super-imposed on each other, it was quite mind-boggling to see this manifest visually before us. Music had taken amazing properties as well, every note resonated with freedom, with idealistic rebellion. One could put a song into geometric shapes in our head, or taste a certain instrument.\\r\\n\\nThe liberation of our senses was at its peak, and we quickly concluded we were children, seeking the best of tastes, the most intense colors, the most comfortable sensations. My friend had developed an affinity to a penny, he then misplaced this penny, and I gave him a different penny to be the place-holder for his new-found friend. This attempt was of course deemed unacceptable, not even a quarter would be suffice. This was by far one of the most abstract interactions I have had with this person, I truly could not figure out what made that certain penny so valuable, and neither could he. We were truly immersed in a playground for perception. The walls would breathe, the lights would pulsate and our minds were free of judgment, we were in pure bliss.\\r\\n\\nAs much fun as we were having playing with our little lava lamp of a house, it was time to go outside again. During a trip, even if one place seems entirely comfortable, I like to go out and explore my surroundings if I can. Stretch myself. The purpose was to see the lights of the city from the top of the south hills in our city, and we made our way there. The world was drowned in obscurity, and the lights of passing cars felt like immense beams of photons to our eyes. We had noticed that most of the people in the neighborhood still had Christmas lights set up, which made our walk very aesthetically pleasing. The hill seemed to continue into infinity, much like the staircase at the top of the castle in Super Mario 64.\\r\\n\\nWe walked and debated philosophical questions, and the more we reasoned, the more we realized the horrors of our own society. We even referred to the unenlightened people as 'the others', not in a condescending way, but in the fact that they wouldn't understand us just as we didn't understand the society they had created for us. Trees with spirals of soft light around them were our companions in our journey to the top of the hill. As time passed, the air was invaded with the densest fog I have ever witnessed, I could truly see the direction of certain sources of light, much like a laser would in a room that has a smoke machine in place. After an eternity of walking and debating, we realized the top of the hill was in private property, this presented us with another problem. Was man really so vain as to claim 'property' (let alone 'privatize' it!) of a piece of the earth? Have we really become to attached to possessions as to say that it is okay to keep part of the planet all for oneself? Of course, after asking these questions to ourselves, we trespassed.\\r\\n\\nWe could not see the city lights in any way we managed, the fog was too dense. We were kind of tired, we surely walked over a mile up this hill, and that was on an empty stomach. We could not rest there, however, the ground was wet and the air was cold. All we could simply do, was look up. Just like some sort of divine intervention, the fog cleared, the clouds dissipated, and the moon was revealed. My mind began racing with thoughts, with feelings, with truth. Eternal energy was a concept hard to dismiss at this point, were were truly touched by something else. It was our monolith, our apex of human evolution, we could understand the way the universe worked, the reason for seasons, the direction of air, the ever-fractal nature of the cosmos. We were one, not just with ourselves, but with every object in the universe. With every fabric of our being, was the way of the heavens manifested upon us. We were not simply humans anymore, we concluded, we were enlightened.\\r\\n\\nThe walk back must have been twice as long as the walk there, somehow, we ended up far away from our host house. We managed to walk back, safely, and with extreme peace in our hearts. Once we were away from major streets, and were in a familiar neighborhood, we decided to run. Running was so liberating, we could choose any pattern of movement, and we feel the air in our faces, and it felt fantastic. We ran all the way to the house like children, in complete amazement, in everlasting joy. Time dilation was extremely present. It was as if our new existence was conceived at the consumption of the four drops from heaven, and nine months later, at the top of that hill, we were born. We were born because for the first time in our lives, we were simply us.  We had overridden the set of standards society had implanted in us as children, we had set flight after breaking open the cage of consciousness, we had broken free of our chains and gotten out of the cave that Plato describes in his famous allegory. We were free, and there was nothing the world could do about it.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the remaining part of the experience coming up with ways to change society, and we concluded that the only possible way was to inspire people to break their head open, to destroy this horrible machine from the inside out. As we concluded, war was insecurity, it was fear, it was ignorance, the very aspects that governed everybody in our society, and we decided to fight back. As the night passed on, we went out for one last taste of the outside world, and headed on to a different playground. We arrived, as the dawn turned the clouds in the sky into chocolate. And we absorbed it all, we breathe in, we live, we transcend. We walked back, and a black cat started to follow us. It was as if it knew that we weren't going to harm it, I got on my knees to pet the cat. The sound of a purring cat was as beautiful as the sound of a baby's laughter, or the wind flowing through the leaves, I cried on the inside. The cat seemed to want to join us inside the house, we decided not to let it become part of our world, we learned to let go, and we closed the door on its innocent eyes, it did not seem to mind.\\r\\n\\nAs we fell in and out of consciousness, it had been roughly twenty hours since the beginning of it all, we smoked a little cannabis to help us go to sleep, as we had to go back to our normal lives in the morning. The learning we did that day, was pure wisdom. The morning came, the room was not liquid, the walls had stop breathing, the lights were back to normal, but we were still simply ourselves.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nThe Year 1999 was the year of my very first 'astro-plane' LSD experience. I became what many call an 'adventurer of the unknown', a 'cliff-rider', 'ledge-walker'. I had experienced perception-shifted inducers before, in small doses, but not to this extent with LSD. Mushrooms, sure, but not with LSD.\\r\\n\\nI knew this girl, who was already graduated, had a kid, but also had a nasty habit with needles. This nasty habit was so strong that it consumed her life. One night she informed me that she had received some interested LSD with pyramids on it. I, as I had been fascinated with perception shifting 'alterations' for a few years now, was enthralled to aquire these from her. When I asked what it would cost, she said 'Just come out with me tonight on this run, and you can have it for free'. Well, how was I to turn that down? A visceral, mystical experience that would be 'given' to me for a little bit of my time?\\r\\n\\nWell, needless to say, where she took me was a stomach-turning affair. Lets just say that needle-fiends, or even worse, needle-fiends that peddle their wares don't make for a fun companion, even if it was for only a few hours. It was at about midnight when she finally dropped me off at home. I was very disgusted with her, but kept it to myself, after all I could relate with her (her being a human being and me understanding the lure that freedom, ease of pain and thirst for ultimate knowledge). In my pocket, four hits of LSD wrapped in tin foil. I eagerly raced to my basement bedroom and unwrapped the foil. Four, cleanly cut squares lay before me, each revealing either a full or partial dark blue/black pyramid that bore an eye in the center. Intrigued, I prepared myself for a long journey. Closing my door, getting comfortable and dimming the lights, I put on some ambient music and dosed. \\r\\n\\nAmazing LSD, that is not in droplet form, takes a while to begin. At least in me it does. Of course, the initial muscle weirdness and odd taste begins almost instantly, mostly from the anticipation I believe. I laid in bed and stared up at my popcorn-like ceiling. I had four candles lit, two on the left side of my room, and two on the right side. I had Aphex Twin's 'Ambient' playing softly in the background. At this point, I would like to mention that I still lived with my parents. I was in high school after all. One of the odd things about living at home and having a deep interest in perception-altering things, is that I never knew when my parents might come to check up on me, which is what my father did.\\r\\n\\nIt had been about one hour since I dosed, I was starting to feel the initial effects, when my father opened my door. He wanted to see how I was, he wanted to talk. So we talked. He had no idea what was about to transpire in my bedroom. During our friendly little chat, I could feel a welling deep inside me, pulsating and dancing to the music I had playing in the background. I was staring at the ceiling as I was talking to my father, and I started to notice the odd fractal and flower petal patterns that I always see on LSD. It was beginning. My stomach got the usual 'empty' feeling I get when the experience kicks off. Its like there is a hole in me, a huge one. But not in a bad way. Maybe it was the feeling of becoming very light, of becoming light itself. This is where I faked being tired so that I could be alone. I knew that in a few minutes, I would not even be able to look into my fathers eyes, I would be in another world.\\r\\n\\nMy room was only lit by candlelight, and my body felt like it was racing faster than sound. The fractal patterns and flower petal shapes spilled onto my breathing walls and my swirling carpet, swaying and slithering around like snakes. I loved this part of the experience. I giggled with glee.  The candles flames danced and created the most wonderful, yet frightful shapes all over my room. I grew antsy and could not lie down any longer, I had to pace around. As I got out of my bed, I felt like I immersed myself in water, in a huge ocean. It was very thick, yet smooth. I could feel pressure on my chest, like waves crashing onto me, and my arms and legs had much difficulty moving around. My whole body tingled and pulsated. I started swaying and sort of dancing in a trance to the ambient music, which turned into shapes inside me. I must have danced like that for a long time, yet only a half an hour had passed.\\r\\n\\nI then decided that I wanted the dark. I blew out the candles, which spilt wax all over the place, and basked in the oddly smelling candle smoke that seemed to fill the darkness. The stereo lights were the only source of illumination, and with it I could see the smoke, as if it was plastic, heavily moving through the air. Once I was immersed in the darkness, I was thrust into another world. A world almost like my bedroom, but vastly different. I got the urge to speak, and I spoke. But every time I said something, it echoed repeatedly, over and over again, like a cycle. I remember feeling that this was very interesting. I must have spoken every word I could muster, just so I could hear it cycle around my room. It was in this precise moment, that I realized that words have power. They are tangible and really heavy things. I watched as my words bounced off of my breathing walls. My words were never harsh, so they bounced lightly and floated through the air. \\r\\n\\nAt this time, the epiphanies and out-of-this-world Deja-vus began. Those realizations of the world, everything in it and my life. My choices, what I needed to do, what I needed to accomplish. Feelings, my feelings, alien feelings surged through me. Visions rattled in front of me. I lost my body and became no-thing, maybe a source of dark light. I floated around my room, which became a grid-like cube. I watched as everything in our known rational world, and everything outside of our rational world was placed somewhere on this grid. I could see it all. I danced around the planets and stars, played with every animal I had ever seen, and bathed in an endless ocean of energy that envigorated me.\\r\\n\\nThe next thing I remember was that I was in/on my bed. I couldn't tell because my body was gone still. Something caught my attention, the grid-like world dissolved and I saw a mirror. My bedroom mirror. In its reflection, I could see this teddy bear that a girl had given me, it danced around and spoke to itself. It even made angry, almost menacing faces/gestures at me. I got scared, which made me laugh to myself, and I stuck my tongue out at it and made raspberry sounds. Then, I got this sudden urge to push my face up against my mirror. I wanted to touch this mirror, smell it, pass through it. In its reflection I could see what looked like my bedroom, but it was somehow different. I wanted so badly to stick my arm inside the mirror, but I was taken aback by an image that began to materialize. I saw towering sky scrapers, those found in big cities, toppling, crumbling and being destroyed. I could literally see this right before me, in the mirror. I remember feeling that the world was ending. That humanity was to pay for our disgressions and our harm to all living things that we feel are 'inferior'. 'This was it' I felt. It turned around and behind me more building were crumbling, as if massive giants brought to their knees. \\r\\n\\nI saw flying beings swooping down from the blackened sky, doing things I could not see, or things that were so far beyond that I had never seen them before. These were not angels, but dragon-lizard like beings. They looked at me and told me, without words, that they were ancient and far older than anything humans had ever known of. They were not dinosaurs or anything like that. I asked them where they were from, not in words, yet they would not tell me. I sensed that they were deeply linked to Earth somehow. They were not like the dragons from story books, more ancient, and more 'real'. Terrifying. I thought they wanted to hurt me and I felt massive fear. It was then that my body came back. I felt it weigh me down and slump me onto my bed. The fear welled up so great that I cowered on my bed.\\r\\n\\nI noticed then that the music had changed, I could hear clanging industrial music playing, that of a Nine Inch Nails remix song. I saw the world ending to the beat of this song. Buildings turned to rubble, massive holes punched into the cities, people dying everywhere. Massive pits of dead bodies and skeletons.\\r\\n\\nI could not remember what had happened after that, but my bedroom was back, and I did not feel the fear anymore. I way laying on my stomach, staring at the darkness. The images were still in my head, and I really wanted to know who those lizard-dragon type beings were and what relation they had to earth. Yet, everything dissolved and I was on a new train of feelings. I had discovered my physical body again and began exploring the sensation of my body. I rolled and squirmed around on the carpet, and played with my hands, my hair. I watched the wonderful fractal patterns dance around my room, and in my eyelids. \\r\\n\\nI could tell that the LSD was taking its course. The peaks were done, all that was left was the coming down.\\r\\n\\nAnd this is the part that I dread the most, especially with LSD that is 'dirty'. Don't get me wrong, this was great LSD, but in terms of purity, it felt like the 'bottom barrel' left-overs. Strycnine heaven! My body ached, like it had been turned inside out and back in again. My head reeled from twisting visions and flower petal designs that over took my room. This is when I glanced at my alarm clock, which I had forgotten existed (I forgot about time itself), and noticed that I would have to go to school in about 4 hours! I panicked, but then realized that I would come down before then.\\r\\n\\nThe last hours of my experience were of a calm and resting nature. Pretty soon I was tired, worn out, like I had experienced too much in one night. Its a usual feeling after an intense trip. Like I have traversed many worlds in the span of a moment. When the sun was shining and it was about 7am, I got ready for school and tried to eat some cereal. I stared into my bowl, watching the milk and thinking about what I had seen on my journey. I felt like I knew a forbidden secret (a feeling that is most prevalent during my perception-shifting experiences), some hidden knowledge or wisdom that the rest of the world did not. Thats when I realized that those who take perception shifters are walking the path of the shaman. It is the shamans task to explore the unknown, learn the vast secrets of the universe and bring them back to our dimension. \\r\\n\\nThis turned out to be my very first 'intense' LSD experience, but it would not be the most intense, or my last.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nAfter a very mild and unexciting acid experience about 3 months earlier, I was not expecting anything close to what happened. I had purchased 4 tabs from a friend so that I could take more if 1 tab was not strong enough. I was supposed to meet a friend in a couple of hours and thought I had some time to kill so I found the tabs and took one. \\r\\n\\nAt first, I was watching this asinine TV show about people running into things and acting like idiots. It called Americas Funniest Videos. Normally I would leave the tv on while doing something else, but suddenly this became the funniest thing I had ever seen. I started to laugh my ass off uncontrollably at every video and could not stop even when my roomate came in. One thing that made it very uncomfortable was that I had not warned my roomates beforehand that I had taken acid and found it very difficult to explain once I was on it, so I just kept trying to avoid them, but that was very hard considering how small our apartment is. Also considering I would keep staring at them and smile which they probably found to be very creepy.\\r\\n\\nSo I was watching the television show, still partly in reality, thinking that this acid must be the mild kind without any hallucinations. Then my eyes settled on the fan that was rotating. There was a light source emanating from the center and the colors became like water, swirling and melting from blue to light blue to white. I was surprised that I was hallucinating and stood up and the entire room became wavy and I felt a bit motion sick. I hobbled to the bathroom with my arms out in front of me and looked in the mirror. I could see my face and it was huge. My flesh was sort of moving around, I felt like I was in an illustration like Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. That is actually the best explanation of what everything around me turned into. I then accidently locked myself in the bathroom and did not know how to get out. I did not want to bother my roomates or freak them out so I stayed in the bathroom for what felt like an hour and thought maybe I would have to climb out the window. I tried with the doorknob again and finally it turned and I was back in the room.\\r\\n\\nIn my mind, I thought I was going on a journey, which I guess I was, and started to pack my backpack with the supplies, laptop, camera, pencils, sketchbook, ipod, ipod speaker, jacket and brought it all to my bed. I spread everything out and opened my laptop and started playing Thelonius Monk. It was the most amazingly beautiful music I had ever heard. I sat on my bed and stared out the window at the condominiums across the street and it was so unexplainable beautiful and the lighting was incredible. Prior to this experience I had felt uncreative and uninspired living in New York because of the superficiality, my school, and the city, but at that moment I realized that the creativity and potential was inside me and all of us and I could find wonder in everything if I looked for it. I realize this all sounds incredibly cliche, but I felt so inspired and all these self revelations were coming to me and I was completely happy and at peace with myself and my abilities. I think I stared at the condominiums for about 5 hours. I cannot really remember my thoughts then, but I remember seeing the most beautiful lights and colors and patterns everywhere and the music was amazing. I also remember thinking that I could never go back to my old life again. That this had completely changed my life and I could never go back knowing what I knew now and thought I understood.\\r\\n\\nThen my laptop died and without music it became less pleasurable. I had also turned my phone to silent because I did not think I could handle talking to anyone. The friend I was supposed to meet had called and when I listened to the voicemail, I started to laugh happily and felt his presence with me. I had opened my window and the cold air was coming into my room, but every time I would shiver, waves of euphoria would flow through my body and I would look at the the lightshow and feel incredibly at peace and happy. Then I realized that I had my ipod with me and started playing Comets on Fire. It was the most intense music I had ever listened to. I went from Comets on Fire, to Volcano, to Velvet Underground, to Blue Cheer, to Jefferson Airplane, to the Wipers. I thought they must have all been on acid when they wrote the music, because it was just too perfect.\\r\\n\\nTime was totally random. I took it at 12 pm and the next time I checked my watch it was 5 pm and dark. The darkness totally intensified the available light. I could not get up and turn on the lights in the room, mostly because I became scared of my roomates and was afraid they would call the police for some reason. At the peak of the acid I was scared, and there was no one to console me except myself. I told myself that it was a journey and that it would eventually end, which helped. So I took out my notebook and started to draw with the light from my cellphone. I believe I did this for like 4 hours. Every pen stroke would light up and then go dark.\\r\\n\\nThis made me very happy to draw. Everything I drew felt like some sort of revelation and it felt like anything was possible. I felt so sure and so capable, like I had found the inner artist in myself. I felt like I had realized my potential. I felt like I was underestimating myself previously and wondered how I could not see the wonder in everything. I remember saying to myself 'why did you not realize the blinds before? they are amazing! The highlights and the shadows alone would make a great painting! I've never realized how wonderful the blinds are!' I pretty much thought shit like this about everything including the dresser.\\r\\n\\nEvery once in a while I would have to get up to go to the bathroom and it was extremely uncomfortable because I did not want to see anyone. I wanted everyone I knew to be with me and experience this new world, and was very sad that they could not see what I was seeing. I was in another universe/dimension and at some point could not distinguish between reality and the trip. I thought the trip had become reality and that I would never go back. Around 10 pm, I was tired, my eyes were tired, and the trip would not end. I sort of wanted it to end, and was uncomfortable because I had been laying in my bed for 10-11 hours at that point without food, water, or any interaction. I could not go outside because of my roomates and did not want to talk to anyone.\\r\\n\\nIt ended around 3 in the morning, and I waited until my roomates were in bed and I went to the bathroom and ate some food and sat on the couch for a while. I then realized that there was writing all over my body and could not remember when or how it got there. One thing that was written was 'The laughing mocks me', I have no idea what that means. I also looked at my notebook and it looked like another person had written all over it. I finally went to sleep for about 4 hours and had to wake up at 9 to go to class. I felt totally out of it. I could not interact with anyone, and felt like I was not stable and could not hold anything. I could not really focus on anything and my eyes kept darting from one person to the next. But I felt like a different person. I was totally sure and at peace with myself. I did not wear any makeup or care, because I felt like I had transcended all of that. I realize this sounds very cliche and retarded, but I felt like I could finally see the beauty and potential of every human being. How much potential I had. How limited we all are.\\r\\n\\nI knew though that I could never do acid in my apartment again. I had to do it where there is a bigger space and a canvas set up with art supplies. I would want to do it alone I think, I do not think I could handle someone else tripping out next to me. I couldn't do it without music either. Yesterday when I was off of it, but still had some feelings left, I wanted to get back to reality, and never thought I would get back there, but now I am back in reality and I want to experience it again. I probably will do half a tab next time. LSD took me to someplace I could never conceive of and showed me how far I can push my senses. It was a really intense experience, and words can never explain what happened. I did not even try to explain it to anyone afterwards because I couldn't.</td>\n",

       "0  \\nFresh from my second experience with LSD and still beaming with the afterglow, I find myself back in the real world of work and taxes and congested transit lines once more. The Australian bush, serene and simple, is an ideal place to trip on this beautiful substance, and I wish I could have stayed forever. But there will be another time, already eagerly awaited, to share this experience again with wonderful friends who understand exactly the joy and wonder of opening your mind to the beauty of natural creation.\\r\\n\\nWhat can I call this trip but my final inauguration into the world of psychedelics? Ive had a rocky start on this journey, bad trips and major let-downs that have filled my mind with doubt and anxiety. Now I feel LSD has taught me the fundamental rules of psychonautics, the same lessons more experienced psychonauts have tried to instil in me, only this time, the sheer power of those hours under the night sky broke through my stubborn expectations and showed me. As they say: life-changing.\\r\\n\\nFirst, a little background. I started out with dextromethorphan, but discontinued after a third plateau trip that left me feeling like a broken soul who didnt really exist. I then moved on to mushrooms, starting with a two gram trip of a potent species, and it all went well enough until I encountered something so horrific, it shattered my resolve to use hallucinogens as tools for self-discovery, and had me traumatised for a week. In the wake of the four worst hours of my life, I spent the next two months piecing together just what had gone so, so wrong. Did I have some neurological disorder that prevents me from having an experience that isnt an acute psychotic episode? If I continued dabbling with these substances, would I lose my mind for good? If not for my desperate need for answers, I would have walked away at that point, and I often felt a wiser person would have done just that.\\r\\n\\nBear with me as I describe this nightmare of a bad trip. Imagine yourself walking about, ruminating on ever more confused and less sane philosophy about being God, when suddenly, all your senses warp into a confused mess. Everything you see, hear and feel no longer makes the slightest sense, as your room transforms into a mesh of colours and you lose the ability to distinguish sound and touch from emotion and thought. It is to find yourself catapulted out of this human existence into some other place where nothing is solid, there is no time, sanity dissolves, and amid the absolute disorientation there is only one clear thought: Oh. Fuck.\\r\\n\\nI have just fucked up my life.\\r\\n\\nIts impossible to say how long this lasted, perhaps a minute, perhaps an hour. The only awareness I had of the outside world was that it must still be there, and that my friends and family must be so horrified that I destroyed my mind on drugs. As it began to clear, and the connections between percept and concept re-established, I looked around the room with only slightly less confusion. What was this place, who was I, what was I? I had no idea. I spent the rest of the trip gradually working through the confusion to find myself again. I awoke next morning to severe depression and a conviction that I would never, ever touch drugs again.\\r\\n\\nThe night had been so confusing that it was only when I took acid two months later that I remembered this disconnect between my perceptions and my ability to interpret, the dissolution of boundary between thought and senses. All I had was vague memories of a hellish experience that felt like serious brain damage. But acid has a unique way of enhancing my imagination, and now that I understand just what happened, Ive come to know it as the Blur.\\r\\n\\nI tried san pedro, only to find the specimen was inactive. I tried weed for the first time at four hits, and it triggered a minor flashback of the Blur, which I no better understood, but it left me feeling that continuing hallucinogen use would be a sure one-way ticket to that psychotic state. But at the urging of experienced psychonauts, I gave it one more shot and dropped half a tab of acid. The result was a beautiful night of euphoria and clear-headedness Ive never known before, a brilliant mental stimulant for an introspective mind. I still harboured anxiety that a full tab might tip me over the edge, but resolved to try it anyway.\\r\\n\\nNow, set and setting. I drove several hours out of the city with two friends, M and G, to a campsite where wed spend the next three days. It was M, a tripper seasoned with four decades of substance use, much of it at this very site, who supplied the acid. G, who sampled ecstasy and was currently enjoying pot every day, only had one psychedelic experience to his name, and it was on LSD some six years earlier. Hed taken two tabs and ended up in a mental ward for the next few months. G is the most genuinely happy and accepting person Ive ever had the pleasure of knowing, and as an enthusiast of consciousness study, he felt ready to give it another try with good company and a beautiful environment. So it was that we set up camp, spent Friday acquainting ourselves with the sunlit groves and acacia fields, the crystalline river and the tens of thousands of datura plants lining its bank. By Saturday, I felt relaxed and peaceful, and ready to plunge into my first full-blown, not-horrible, psychedelic experience.\\r\\n\\nWe dropped the tabs at 3p.m. on Saturday. M felt it would be best to start late afternoon, as the night ambience and starlight is beautiful on acid. We both took one tab, while G took a half. Theres no way to be sure, but I estimate their strength at 80µg, and though Im interested in heavy experiences down the road, I dont see myself ever taking this particular substance at more than 120µg, nor using it more than once a year. Beautiful though it was, I also think I may be one of those rare people who appreciates low-dose acid, perhaps in conjunction with another substance, for its unobtrusive consciousness expansion and creative mindset. On this night, though, the one tab was perfect.\\r\\n\\nAs we started feeling the effects, we left the campsite and took a walk off-road into the sunburnt gullies and the hills abundant with kangaroos. Some describe the acid come-up as hard and pushy, but I think its wonderful. I soon had a big smile on my face and not a care in the world. The LSD was tweaking my consciousness and we were laughing at the stupidest things, yet my thoughts became crisp, unburdened. And then less than an hour in, something happened that almost derailed the experience.\\r\\n\\nI was looking at the dirt as I walked... and I had an experiential flash of another state of mind that made me think... What if, as Im walking along, everything I see, hear, taste and smell, and all of my thoughts and feelings, blur into a total incoherent mesh? ... Oh, shit. Thats exactly what happened on shrooms, isnt it.\\r\\n\\nIn an instant, my euphoria was gone. I was starting to get very worried. LSD truly gives me amazing imaginative power, and I couldnt help but imagine exactly what it would be like if the Blur struck right then. It would propel me into a state of total schizophrenia. I would be walking alongside my friends and reality would just disintegrate, and that would be the end. I might never recover. I might be trapped in that other world, that horrible Blur, forever. And thats the price I pay for taking too much LSD  those people who encouraged me to go for it were wrong, this really is going to destroy my mind.\\r\\n\\nI was shaken. Simply by imagining it, I seemed to be invoking the fucking thing, just by the sheer vivid power of my imagination.\\r\\n\\nMy friends knew my history. I could never in good conscience trip with people and not tell them Id had less than stellar experiences with psychedelics. But I kept my mouth shut and resolved to get through this alone. If I told them something was wrong, their carefree air might turn to concern, and that would only make things worse. Besides, if the Blur was going to happen, it would happen, there was no stopping it. I knew I was wavering on the edge of another bad trip just by inviting that doubt into my mind, so I gritted my teeth, anchored myself in reality, and resolved to endure my own anxiety. Acid is such a powerful substance; it only takes one wrong thought pattern to make it all go to hell. I knew this, and Id learnt enough from my previous bad trips to not fall for the tricks my mind was playing on me. So there I was, in limbo between good trip and bad, wrestling to keep it together. Had I taken more, I probably wouldnt have been able.\\r\\n\\nThe sun was almost setting as we made our way back to camp. My main concern by now was whether I actually had any control over whether the trip went well or not. After all, I pondered, how does this work, exactly? People take acid with good set and setting, and sometimes it goes wrong anyway  is that a random chemical fluctuation, or do they just give in to scary thoughts like the ones Im having? Am I in control here? I parted from M and G, who I later found out were wrestling their own demons, and laid down in the grass to focus my attention on the river and calm down.\\r\\n\\nThis was where I got my first visuals. The cliff face across the water began to morph. The longer I stared at it, the more it twisted. It was a subtle, slow process, and as soon as I looked away, it became solid again. I looked up at the trees above the cliff face, and the entire hillside they rested on started bending, so it looked like the landscape was bowing to me. Quite different from mushroom visuals, which are more electrical and remind me of Alex Greys artwork. What they share in common is that the transformation goes deeper the more you stare at the object.\\r\\n\\nI remained nervous and my anxiety seemed to permeate the air, like a presence in the valley. For the next while, I felt that whatever I was doing, I really ought to be doing something else to get a grip, before this anxiety became the dark and terrifying presence of a bad LSD trip. I thought chatting with my friends might work, but found it stressful to keep a happy composure around them. I found being too far away from them didnt help either, because Id be on my own and might get lost if things went bad. Youd think the middle ground of being in their vicinity would work, but it didnt. So what saved me? Laughter.\\r\\n\\nI was sitting in the caravan, trying to write down trip notes. G was saying how impressed he was that I could write anything at all, because he, on half a tab, couldnt manage more than one word. (Incidentally, everything I wrote was quite coherent and legible, but I soon gave up because there was too much happening and writing by hand is sooo slooow on acid.) Anyway, I was having trouble concentrating on what he was saying, so at one point I nodded and said, Mm... thats right... Excuse me. I need to go outside and watch some rocks morph.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the next five minutes laughing hysterically. The rest of the trip was awesome.\\r\\n\\nIt was far from the last funny thing that happened  indeed, our conversations became a strange mix of philosophy, rating burps out of ten, and the most profound fart humour possible... more philosophy, and puns so bad we had to laugh, or occasionally so great we... had to laugh. I was doing most of the philosophy, and I felt an overwhelming need to share it. LSD is very expressive, for me. On the half tab the week before, Id written seventeen pages of things I felt needed to be said, in three hours. Here, I was saying things like, Solipsism can be practical. Embrace self-centredness, but dont let it absorb you. G thought this was brilliant, and insisted I return to the caravan and write down every such thing I said. Every experience I have, with all the existential subtleties, the nuances of feeling  all of it is so unique and how else could I, God, experience it, than to not know I am immortal? M was there to bring us back to reality, and we spent as much time taking the piss out of ourselves as we did legitimately pontificating, until the two merged into one and I announced: The real Zen master knows that Zen is bullshit.\\r\\n\\nYes, acid is a very thinking drug, and I return to what I said before about low doses. Thirty or forty milligrams would be ideal if you need a lateral solution to a problem.\\r\\n\\nPeriodically, I left the fire wed built to stand alone under the stars. Here, I became melancholy. I thought about my problems, the chronic dissociation in my life that makes it impossible to even want to be part of human civilization. I felt bitter that LSD wasnt helping me find a way to heal that, as Id hoped it might. I thought about death and non-existence, what an incredible waste it is, and how stupid it is that were supposed to find any consolation in one day not experiencing reality. Fuck you, I said to the beautiful face of the Goddess that formed in the sky. She was there everywhere I looked, a serene face of many forms composed of the million stars in the clear night sky. I gave her the finger.\\r\\n\\nLater, I wandered about and reflected on my bad mushroom trip, and how Id felt close to slipping back into it before. What had that all been about? It was the Blur, I realised. At last I could remember just what had happened, how my brain had stopped making sense of my every perception and, not being in any way prepared for it, Id panicked. That trip didnt necessarily have to be a bad one. I just didnt have the experience to handle it. And the reason Id spent the rest of it having a psychotic episode wherein I alternately believed I was God, a patient in a mental hospital, a prisoner in my room for eternity, etc. was because I had no idea what to do with something like that. It had completely thrown me. Theres a knack to this tripping thing, thats why more experienced users can take high-dose DMT and hold it together. \\r\\n\\nWhat was it theyd told me? Whatever happens, dont fight it, you have to ride it out. Id had trouble believing that before. Surely if you dont fight the real psychotic thoughts, thats when you break down and end up in a mental ward, like my friend G on his first time. But now it made sense. Even the ones who do lose it, theyre not still tripping when theyre in hospital. Theyre just insane. There was no danger of the Blur ever lasting for my entire life; I would always come down from it, and the only way lasting damage could occur would be if, indeed, I resisted it, and believed I was losing my mind. Because that is traumatic, and a powerful enough blast of it would be enough to unhinge anyone, the same way watching your lover get tortured, raped and murdered would be enough to send someone over the edge.\\r\\n\\nTherefore, the solution was always to ride it out, and have an anchor. If I find my ego blasted to the four corners of reality, I need only hold on to one thing: This is a trip. It is not real. It will pass. And I could have done that, even during the Blur. But I gave in to the fear that Id just lost my mind for good, which was exactly how it felt, and it had destroyed me.\\r\\n\\nStill, a doubt lingered. How could I be sure about this? And then, I had my answer.\\r\\n\\nI went back to the fireplace, and asked M and G to give me some weed.\\r\\n\\nJust one hit, I said, and explained what I was trying to do. Last time I smoked, it had invoked the Blur in a mild shroom flashback. At the time, I had interpreted it as psychosis. It hadnt been as intense as the full thing, but it was still scary and highly uncomfortable, so I decided never to smoke pot again  basically, I decided to run away from the problem. Now, I was turning volte-face and confronting it. This would be my test. My initiation into the world of tripping. And if I was wrong, I would probably lose my mind.\\r\\n\\nI took a good deep hit, laid back to watch the fire, and waited.\\r\\n\\nMarijuana and acid have wonderful synergy. You feel heavy and incredibly relaxed, yet far from incapacitated. Conversations drift off in a hundred tangents, yet you always come back to what you started with and you never forget what you were saying. The dynamic of our little group was simply perfect, three misfits of varying ages figuring out the meaning of life in our own ways, feeling wed glimpsed enlightenment. It was incredible. Im a lightweight with weed, and the acid seemed to potentiate it, so pretty soon, I was pleasantly stoned. And then, just like I predicted, the Blur crept into the fabric of my consciousness about an hour in.\\r\\n\\nAt first, it was very subtle. I noticed some confusion about the tea I was drinking, how the sensation of warm liquid going down my throat didnt seem to make sense. How could it be happening in space and time when it was just a sensation? Sensations dont have dimension. (Perhaps youve experienced something similar on drugs; if not, you probably wont be able to follow.) Gradually it intensified. Our campfire conversation became a far-away mesh of meaningless percept. Yet I held fast to my goal. I did not panic. Whenever I felt Id gone too far out, I reminded myself I was tripping, and endured it. The dissociation from self and identity, the blurring of the line between thought and the external world, sunk into my consciousness. But the warm glow of acid helped me through it. Everything felt right, even the atemporal, non-spatial stomach cramps I was having. All in all, on Blur scale, it reached a three or a four out of ten, and I was still able to hold conversation despite the powerful dissociation. My last experience on weed might make a five on that scale, and on mushrooms, where everything got obliterated, a ten. I didnt need a five or a ten. This preview of it was enough to know that next time I encounter it, Ill be ready.\\r\\n\\nAnd the weed slowly wore off, and we started coming down from the acid.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the rest of the night until 3a.m. playing music from the caravan, and eating campfire food and chocolate. Music on LSD is not as good as on DXM and definitely not as good as mushrooms, but it still gels with the everything-is-just-right glow of acid. Food, however, is transcendentally awesome. Fruit explodes in your mouth. The texture of dark chocolate cracking apart into sweet chunks, the salty potatoes disintegrating on your tongue with hot butter, the onion and (non-psychedelic) mushrooms rich with oil... perfect. We shared previous experiences on drugs  G insisted I write down my description of DXM: Feeling like youve lost 30 IQ points, and good riddance. We stood under the stars again, and this time the Goddess turned into a vampire goth chick, and we all spotted geometric connections between the brighter stars. Visuals had mostly passed by this point, but we continued to notice how the stars looked like little lanterns hanging a few hundred metres overhead instead of thousands of light years away, and how the tin foil around the potatoes looked like breath-taking crystal skulls, or the heads of a Terminator or Optimus Prime. Finally, M fell asleep, and me and G retired to our tent.\\r\\n\\nUnfortunately, I found it impossible to sleep, and spent the next hour tossing and turning. I was getting faint closed-eye visuals, much like what I picture from a very weak hit of DMT. At first they were slow-moving geometric patterns and shapes, morphing smoothly in dreamlike fashion. But as I got more frustrated, they turned into rotten teeth and hideous dinosaur skeletons. Eventually, I realised that with my last, half-tab experience on acid, what Id interpreted as a hangover had in fact been the trip continuing. That day, Id remained dissociated even the next night at work, and I was still having trippy thoughts and a generally altered perception. This time, Id taken more, so it was stronger. My conclusion: for some reason, I peak normally, but I continue tripping for a long time on acid, perhaps about thirty hours. It was impossible to sleep while tripping, so I woke M up and asked for some Valium. It knocked me out mid-sentence in conversation with G.\\r\\n\\nThe next day was glorious. We wandered the national park and I was in love with everything. All so warm and colourful and orgasmic! I felt proud of my decision to face the Blur and my victory over it, and I was looking ahead to my future psychedelic experiences. I think I will try san pedro next, and then ayahuasca and DMT, if I feel up to the incredible mind-fuck. This had been my best trip so far and certainly I took a lot away from it. I have an enhanced appreciation of life, even though I still struggle with what seems to be a mild form of derealisation disorder, and I have hope now that with the help of psychedelic drugs, Ill one day find the answers Im so desperately looking for. Psychonautics is a legitimate psychospiritual discipline for those who want to use drugs that way, and hopefully one day, society will recognise that. A legitimate path for those who seek self-discovery. Trip on and may you all find the peace I had when I sat before that fire and glimpsed, just for a few hours, perfect contentment.   \n",
       "1  \\nFirst, a little background. I am not your typical psychonaut, well, at least not stereotypical. I am a high technology major in University; Id like to consider myself relatively well adjusted, and relatively safe in most of my endeavors. Prior to this experience, I had done no other drug other than ganja, I found the concept of psychoactive substances frightening, and didn't consider myself ready for the experience.\\r\\n\\nThis past summer, a good friend who I had lived with in a Dorm that year contacted me about going to a rave, a music festival really. On a sparsely populated island legendary in the area for the open-minded populace, and frequent drug use. I agreed to go, as did three of my other good friends.\\r\\n\\nWe went to this festival, a three day affair, the previous week I had been preparing myself for it, reading all I possibly could about LSD. Bolstered by my newfound knowledge, I arrived to the event, and set up camp. Being as that this was a three day affair, we agreed that we should plan our trip. That night we partied, enjoyed the good music, didnt really sleep, but had a good time. The next morning, we all awoke and started to make preparations, we agreed to eat these little sugar cubes a friend had acquired, liquid locally produced, pack a bag with supplies, and then set off down the beach. We ate the sugar cubes, all joked nervously, packed a bag with water, pot, and a camera and set out. There were four of us, only one had tripped before, we really had no idea what we were in for.\\r\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, the rocks started to sparkle. We where walking down the beach, enjoying the beautiful weather, when we started to point out the beauty of the stones, their place, their job, their perfection. At this point, we knew it was starting to kick in.\\r\\n\\nTripping steadily, we ducked into the forest, a likely sheltered wooded path providing the perfect venue in which to experience our newfound expanded perception. I felt truly alive, I had embarked on this trip to try to find something I didnt know I was missing, it quickly became evident that my truth was lying just beyond the horizon.\\r\\n\\nThe forest was beautiful, more beautiful than anything Ive ever seen before in my life. Plants were not just plants... they where an extension of the planets beauty. Bees buzzed with a purpose, not simply diving and weaving aimlessly, but traveling with duty. Realizing most of the plants around us actually stinging nettle (think poison ivy\n",
       " but Canadian) we returned to the beach, rounding the corner to possibly the most confusing situation we could have.\\r\\n\\nThere stood, on the beach, a cabin. Keep in mind, this is NOT a city. This is a beach that requires 20 minutes of off-road travel to simply reach, electricity ending 30 or 40 kilometers back up the island. And here lies a cabin. Approaching the building warily, I felt like we werent ready for it. Like it was not our place, it was not the right time for this building, however, we entered cautiously. The cabin was furnished, not only with the standard couches, but a television, vcr, and stack of movies, quickly becoming apparent that a generator was required for full operation. Relics of past trips lie all around us. Here a picture, there a stack of beer cans, carved in the wood of the walls lie the reminders of previous adventures. Walking over to a side table, I picked up a curious scrap of paper, yellowed with time, it read:\\r\\n\\nWould you rather step in quicksand?\\r\\nOr spend your entire life\\r\\nAvoiding it\\r\\n\\nThis rang deep. Deeper than three lines should, looking at each other in wonder, we decided that we needed to keep moving. The empty place seemed too large for us, seemed too hard to comprehend. Hoisting our bag of tricks high, we left, staring back at the tiny house, wondering what other secrets it held.\\r\\n\\nBy this time, in the hot sun, we had finished two bottles of water, having no pockets due to shorts; I tied the empty containers to the corners of a bright green bandanna, letting it hang from a belt loop. Suddenly I felt the need to complete it, picking up a stone; I tied a third corner off, a bright red lighter completing the fourth. Holding my creation aloft I placed it upon my friends head, and there he stood dubbed: Captain Acid Hat.\\r\\n\\nOnward Captain Acid Hat and his band ventured, walking down the pristine beach, leaping from rock to rock, enjoying the experience of having our senses unleashed.\\r\\n\\nHere we diverge from pure narrative and into theory. When experiencing such emotions, I pondered, what could possibly cause such a shift in reality? Was Captain Acid Hats amazing adventure simply fantasy? Were we all experiencing random synapses firing that caused the plants to seem so alive, the bees to seem so committed, and the water to sparkle like the light of a thousand suns? Or was it something else, deeper.\\r\\n\\nSpiritual? Unlikely. I am a man of technology, I entertain few delusions of theology, in fact, one of my greatest fears was the possibility of experiencing a spiritual vision, what if Im wrong? What if Im faced with the reality of a Christian theology? How would I deal with my entire worldview being shattered? No, this was more. Spirituality was minor in the world I experienced, where there a god he would be humbled by the beauty present in everyday things.\\r\\n\\nMy theory is this: To assume and assert that our five senses represent the culmination of the universes experience is not only arrogant, but dead wrong. It has frequently been suggested by far smarter men than I that we exist in a tiny bubble of reality, our brains are wired through evolution to handle only so much input, so much feeling. But we take it all in, our eyes see everything, our eyes see radio waves, our eyes see other crossing dimensions, our eyes take in everything that exists, but our brain filters it out.\\r\\n\\nLSD is not a harsh chemical, it is not a brutal taskmaster, forcing me into an altered state of consciousness, its a switch, flicking it opened my mind, and I believe, reduces the filters placed between me and reality. For the first time, when I looked at those sparking rocks, I saw them for what they were, without the muddling filters of my brain blocking it.\\r\\n\\nBut back to the story.\\r\\n\\nRounding another bend, we spied the end of our journey. The beach ended, curved up into a rocky bluff, impossible to climb in our state, but affording an amazing vantage point, shaded as it was by the thick tree cover on the hill. We made camp, opened our bag of tricks, and started to talk. About everything, about life, about our experience, we related it quite strongly to simply being stoned out of our gourds, the lot of us surprised at how gentle it was. Our minds were not addled nor chained, we could think, we could talk, hell, Im sure that given the right motivation we could dance, had we not other, more important things on our minds.\\r\\n\\nPacking a bowl took an hour and a half, but we didnt notice, the slow process of grinding passed between us all, rotating seemingly in an organized pattern. Three members of the group would engage in deep discussion while the fourth would be off on their own, watching the water, or the trees, or the rocks, or the weed, never really becoming detached, simply orbiting, it reminded me a lot of a solar system.\\r\\n\\nWe discussed the note from the cabin, its significance, possible theories for its meaning and the place it was found in. We evolved, we became stronger, and on that beach, sitting in the shade, staring and trying to comprehend a tugboat moving across the strait, I found what I was looking for, the missing piece to my life. To a stranger it is unexplainable, but rest assured, I needed to find it.\\r\\n\\nThe sun rose in the sky, becoming mighty at its zenith, and started to descend as the afternoon wore on. Our shade retreated, becoming brighter and brighter, until our cool perch became hot. We decided it was time to head back to the camp. Walking back to the cabin, I noticed the only downside to the entire weekend, in my eagerness to set out, I had forgotten to apply sunscreen to my left arm, the skin was bright red and obviously sunburned. I took captain acid hat back, drenched it in seawater, and placed it over my arm, tying it tight and keeping the sun off it.\\r\\n\\nWe once again reached the cabin. But now it was different, it wasnt hostile, it was inviting. It had judged us, and finding us worthy, became a happy place to be. It became our cabin, our place of refuge from the sun, we explored it, laughed at its jokes, its quirks, doubling up in hilarity as we discovered the foil packets arranged on the table contained dried magic mushrooms, we left them, had no need of them.\\r\\n\\nWe packed a bowl, and then I stood, looking over to the tv that couldnt possibly turn on, spying a drawing on top of it. It was beautiful, simply patterns in crayon, and on the back. Tripping in the cabin, lots of love, john and Marcy, new years 2006. I realized we needed to leave our mark, looking back at my friends, laughing on the old dusty couch, it came to me:\\r\\n\\nYou will never know what youre seeking\\r\\nUntil you find it.\\r\\n\\n-July 2008\\r\\n\\nPlacing the note down, we smoked a bowl and decided to set back, braving the unforgiving sun once again to arrive home, the music of the stage reached us first, bounced over the water, and we started to see tents again, people. Interacting with humans again was peculiar, I felt enlightened, strengthened.\\r\\n\\nWe discovered (much to our delight) that the beach we tred upon was actually a nude beach, and the tanned flesh of dozens of beauties lounged about, smiling to ourselves we made our way back to our campsite, to bottles of water, and the end to a wonderful experience.\\r\\n\\nLSD Changed my life. It wasnt huge, I didnt drop my major and live in the forest, nor did I freak out and swear it off forever, I simply realized how Id been going about things wrong. I am a changed man due to this wonderful chemical, and a stronger human being from that beach.

       "2  \\nTo say that I have tasted the purity of reason is an understatement. The human mind is certainly a beautiful product of evolution. The world is full of amazing processes and cycles, and to even begin to understand some of these is an incredible experience, one which will surely change my life forever. Like many people before me, I have always been intrigued by the subconscious, that which is the very fabric of our dreams, that which explains our actions to an extreme amount of detail, and of course that which frees us from the everyday worries that we are faced with in this society. And whatever actions I chose to take in the past, it all culminated to a single day, which will forever be imprinted in my head as 'the best goddamn day of my life'.\\r\\n\\nIt all started one day, when a friend tells me that he is able to obtain a vial containing liquid d-lysergic acid diethylamide or 'LSD'. This was joyous to me, simply because LSD had provided me with amazing and fun experiences in the past, and this time it could be repeated with LSD in a form that was both pure and potent. Needless to say a few friends and I purchased a bottle, and we each took a total of four drops of this mystical substance.\\r\\n\\nI was not new to psychedelics at this stage of my life, having dabbled in Mushrooms, LSD, Salvia Divinorum and Morning Glory seeds. So it was surprising for me that I had difficulty at the beginning of this voyage in that I did not have any hold over the experience.  This was by far the highest dose of LSD (considering how diluted earlier doses were, in comparison) I have ever taken, and that was quite evident in the initial body load. We made the decision to go somewhere out in nature, after having noticed the amazing visual changes that come with an acid trip in the home we had dropped it in.  Seeing nature has proven to be very successful at 'saving' the experience in the past. Sure enough, we were still uncomfortably vulnerable to everything around us, but somehow we found solace in our own thoughts. We began debating about various topics, such as what it meant to be human, what it meant to think, and what everything else meant to us. We were surely an odd looking group of people walking in strange ways around a church playground, but this did not bother us all that much.  Near dusk, we sat on a curb, as we talked about life. At this point, everything I knew about the 'self' began to dissolve.  Slowly but surely, our egos melded into the immense cosmic energy that enveloped us.\\r\\n\\nThe sunset came right as the dissolution of our egos was completed. A spectacle of color blending into air, and air blending into color. Never before had I seen something so moving, so inspiring, so true. I could nearly taste the colors in the sky, needless to say I truly understood The Beatles when they sang about 'marmalade skies'. It felt as if we had been under the influence of the substance for days, however it was only six in the afternoon, and had only been four hours since we noticed the initial effects of the drug. All of these overwhelming emotions of abiding joy and happiness indicated that we were getting into a lot more than we bargained for, and we were about to find why.\\r\\n\\nThe confusing reactions of the people around us eventually became nothing more than a cue for us to leave said playground. The walk back to the house was surely a fast one, since I have little recollection of it, surely it was unimportant compared to other events that happened that day. We arrived and we put on some music and relaxed, still talking about the miracle we had witnessed. At this point it was as if all of our egos were combined into a cloud of consciousness that rested directly on top of us. A person in the group could say something, and that thought would be completely understood by everybody in the group. One could say just one word and everyone would be able to follow a slew of topics and intents behind it.\\r\\n\\nWe had been thinking and talking the whole time, debating some of life's greatest mysteries. The house had been painted an intense orange color and the majority of the objects in the bathroom had the same intense color to them. This covered everything and everybody in ever-flowing hues of orange. The air in the room seemed liquid, I could move my hand and it would ripple out the image behind it, leaving trails of my hand in the air. There was about three or four moths inside the room, and their flight patterns were quite evident with the semi-viscous liquid properties the room had taken. They seemed to fly in predictable patterns, that of sine and cosine waves super-imposed on each other, it was quite mind-boggling to see this manifest visually before us. Music had taken amazing properties as well, every note resonated with freedom, with idealistic rebellion. One could put a song into geometric shapes in our head, or taste a certain instrument.\\r\\n\\nThe liberation of our senses was at its peak, and we quickly concluded we were children, seeking the best of tastes, the most intense colors, the most comfortable sensations. My friend had developed an affinity to a penny, he then misplaced this penny, and I gave him a different penny to be the place-holder for his new-found friend. This attempt was of course deemed unacceptable, not even a quarter would be suffice. This was by far one of the most abstract interactions I have had with this person, I truly could not figure out what made that certain penny so valuable, and neither could he. We were truly immersed in a playground for perception. The walls would breathe, the lights would pulsate and our minds were free of judgment, we were in pure bliss.\\r\\n\\nAs much fun as we were having playing with our little lava lamp of a house, it was time to go outside again. During a trip, even if one place seems entirely comfortable, I like to go out and explore my surroundings if I can. Stretch myself. The purpose was to see the lights of the city from the top of the south hills in our city, and we made our way there. The world was drowned in obscurity, and the lights of passing cars felt like immense beams of photons to our eyes. We had noticed that most of the people in the neighborhood still had Christmas lights set up, which made our walk very aesthetically pleasing. The hill seemed to continue into infinity, much like the staircase at the top of the castle in Super Mario 64.\\r\\n\\nWe walked and debated philosophical questions, and the more we reasoned, the more we realized the horrors of our own society. We even referred to the unenlightened people as 'the others', not in a condescending way, but in the fact that they wouldn't understand us just as we didn't understand the society they had created for us. Trees with spirals of soft light around them were our companions in our journey to the top of the hill. As time passed, the air was invaded with the densest fog I have ever witnessed, I could truly see the direction of certain sources of light, much like a laser would in a room that has a smoke machine in place. After an eternity of walking and debating, we realized the top of the hill was in private property, this presented us with another problem. Was man really so vain as to claim 'property' (let alone 'privatize' it!) of a piece of the earth? Have we really become to attached to possessions as to say that it is okay to keep part of the planet all for oneself? Of course, after asking these questions to ourselves, we trespassed.\\r\\n\\nWe could not see the city lights in any way we managed, the fog was too dense. We were kind of tired, we surely walked over a mile up this hill, and that was on an empty stomach. We could not rest there, however, the ground was wet and the air was cold. All we could simply do, was look up. Just like some sort of divine intervention, the fog cleared, the clouds dissipated, and the moon was revealed. My mind began racing with thoughts, with feelings, with truth. Eternal energy was a concept hard to dismiss at this point, were were truly touched by something else. It was our monolith, our apex of human evolution, we could understand the way the universe worked, the reason for seasons, the direction of air, the ever-fractal nature of the cosmos. We were one, not just with ourselves, but with every object in the universe. With every fabric of our being, was the way of the heavens manifested upon us. We were not simply humans anymore, we concluded, we were enlightened.\\r\\n\\nThe walk back must have been twice as long as the walk there, somehow, we ended up far away from our host house. We managed to walk back, safely, and with extreme peace in our hearts. Once we were away from major streets, and were in a familiar neighborhood, we decided to run. Running was so liberating, we could choose any pattern of movement, and we feel the air in our faces, and it felt fantastic. We ran all the way to the house like children, in complete amazement, in everlasting joy. Time dilation was extremely present. It was as if our new existence was conceived at the consumption of the four drops from heaven, and nine months later, at the top of that hill, we were born. We were born because for the first time in our lives, we were simply us.  We had overridden the set of standards society had implanted in us as children, we had set flight after breaking open the cage of consciousness, we had broken free of our chains and gotten out of the cave that Plato describes in his famous allegory. We were free, and there was nothing the world could do about it.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the remaining part of the experience coming up with ways to change society, and we concluded that the only possible way was to inspire people to break their head open, to destroy this horrible machine from the inside out. As we concluded, war was insecurity, it was fear, it was ignorance, the very aspects that governed everybody in our society, and we decided to fight back. As the night passed on, we went out for one last taste of the outside world, and headed on to a different playground. We arrived, as the dawn turned the clouds in the sky into chocolate. And we absorbed it all, we breathe in, we live, we transcend. We walked back, and a black cat started to follow us. It was as if it knew that we weren't going to harm it, I got on my knees to pet the cat. The sound of a purring cat was as beautiful as the sound of a baby's laughter, or the wind flowing through the leaves, I cried on the inside. The cat seemed to want to join us inside the house, we decided not to let it become part of our world, we learned to let go, and we closed the door on its innocent eyes, it did not seem to mind.\\r\\n\\nAs we fell in and out of consciousness, it had been roughly twenty hours since the beginning of it all, we smoked a little cannabis to help us go to sleep, as we had to go back to our normal lives in the morning. The learning we did that day, was pure wisdom. The morning came, the room was not liquid, the walls had stop breathing, the lights were back to normal, but we were still simply ourselves.

       "3  \\nThe Year 1999 was the year of my very first 'astro-plane' LSD experience. I became what many call an 'adventurer of the unknown', a 'cliff-rider', 'ledge-walker'. I had experienced perception-shifted inducers before, in small doses, but not to this extent with LSD. Mushrooms, sure, but not with LSD.\\r\\n\\nI knew this girl, who was already graduated, had a kid, but also had a nasty habit with needles. This nasty habit was so strong that it consumed her life. One night she informed me that she had received some interested LSD with pyramids on it. I, as I had been fascinated with perception shifting 'alterations' for a few years now, was enthralled to aquire these from her. When I asked what it would cost, she said 'Just come out with me tonight on this run, and you can have it for free'. Well, how was I to turn that down? A visceral, mystical experience that would be 'given' to me for a little bit of my time?\\r\\n\\nWell, needless to say, where she took me was a stomach-turning affair. Lets just say that needle-fiends, or even worse, needle-fiends that peddle their wares don't make for a fun companion, even if it was for only a few hours. It was at about midnight when she finally dropped me off at home. I was very disgusted with her, but kept it to myself, after all I could relate with her (her being a human being and me understanding the lure that freedom, ease of pain and thirst for ultimate knowledge). In my pocket, four hits of LSD wrapped in tin foil. I eagerly raced to my basement bedroom and unwrapped the foil. Four, cleanly cut squares lay before me, each revealing either a full or partial dark blue/black pyramid that bore an eye in the center. Intrigued, I prepared myself for a long journey. Closing my door, getting comfortable and dimming the lights, I put on some ambient music and dosed. \\r\\n\\nAmazing LSD, that is not in droplet form, takes a while to begin. At least in me it does. Of course, the initial muscle weirdness and odd taste begins almost instantly, mostly from the anticipation I believe. I laid in bed and stared up at my popcorn-like ceiling. I had four candles lit, two on the left side of my room, and two on the right side. I had Aphex Twin's 'Ambient' playing softly in the background. At this point, I would like to mention that I still lived with my parents. I was in high school after all. One of the odd things about living at home and having a deep interest in perception-altering things, is that I never knew when my parents might come to check up on me, which is what my father did.\\r\\n\\nIt had been about one hour since I dosed, I was starting to feel the initial effects, when my father opened my door. He wanted to see how I was, he wanted to talk. So we talked. He had no idea what was about to transpire in my bedroom. During our friendly little chat, I could feel a welling deep inside me, pulsating and dancing to the music I had playing in the background. I was staring at the ceiling as I was talking to my father, and I started to notice the odd fractal and flower petal patterns that I always see on LSD. It was beginning. My stomach got the usual 'empty' feeling I get when the experience kicks off. Its like there is a hole in me, a huge one. But not in a bad way. Maybe it was the feeling of becoming very light, of becoming light itself. This is where I faked being tired so that I could be alone. I knew that in a few minutes, I would not even be able to look into my fathers eyes, I would be in another world.\\r\\n\\nMy room was only lit by candlelight, and my body felt like it was racing faster than sound. The fractal patterns and flower petal shapes spilled onto my breathing walls and my swirling carpet, swaying and slithering around like snakes. I loved this part of the experience. I giggled with glee.  The candles flames danced and created the most wonderful, yet frightful shapes all over my room. I grew antsy and could not lie down any longer, I had to pace around. As I got out of my bed, I felt like I immersed myself in water, in a huge ocean. It was very thick, yet smooth. I could feel pressure on my chest, like waves crashing onto me, and my arms and legs had much difficulty moving around. My whole body tingled and pulsated. I started swaying and sort of dancing in a trance to the ambient music, which turned into shapes inside me. I must have danced like that for a long time, yet only a half an hour had passed.\\r\\n\\nI then decided that I wanted the dark. I blew out the candles, which spilt wax all over the place, and basked in the oddly smelling candle smoke that seemed to fill the darkness. The stereo lights were the only source of illumination, and with it I could see the smoke, as if it was plastic, heavily moving through the air. Once I was immersed in the darkness, I was thrust into another world. A world almost like my bedroom, but vastly different. I got the urge to speak, and I spoke. But every time I said something, it echoed repeatedly, over and over again, like a cycle. I remember feeling that this was very interesting. I must have spoken every word I could muster, just so I could hear it cycle around my room. It was in this precise moment, that I realized that words have power. They are tangible and really heavy things. I watched as my words bounced off of my breathing walls. My words were never harsh, so they bounced lightly and floated through the air. \\r\\n\\nAt this time, the epiphanies and out-of-this-world Deja-vus began. Those realizations of the world, everything in it and my life. My choices, what I needed to do, what I needed to accomplish. Feelings, my feelings, alien feelings surged through me. Visions rattled in front of me. I lost my body and became no-thing, maybe a source of dark light. I floated around my room, which became a grid-like cube. I watched as everything in our known rational world, and everything outside of our rational world was placed somewhere on this grid. I could see it all. I danced around the planets and stars, played with every animal I had ever seen, and bathed in an endless ocean of energy that envigorated me.\\r\\n\\nThe next thing I remember was that I was in/on my bed. I couldn't tell because my body was gone still. Something caught my attention, the grid-like world dissolved and I saw a mirror. My bedroom mirror. In its reflection, I could see this teddy bear that a girl had given me, it danced around and spoke to itself. It even made angry, almost menacing faces/gestures at me. I got scared, which made me laugh to myself, and I stuck my tongue out at it and made raspberry sounds. Then, I got this sudden urge to push my face up against my mirror. I wanted to touch this mirror, smell it, pass through it. In its reflection I could see what looked like my bedroom, but it was somehow different. I wanted so badly to stick my arm inside the mirror, but I was taken aback by an image that began to materialize. I saw towering sky scrapers, those found in big cities, toppling, crumbling and being destroyed. I could literally see this right before me, in the mirror. I remember feeling that the world was ending. That humanity was to pay for our disgressions and our harm to all living things that we feel are 'inferior'. 'This was it' I felt. It turned around and behind me more building were crumbling, as if massive giants brought to their knees. \\r\\n\\nI saw flying beings swooping down from the blackened sky, doing things I could not see, or things that were so far beyond that I had never seen them before. These were not angels, but dragon-lizard like beings. They looked at me and told me, without words, that they were ancient and far older than anything humans had ever known of. They were not dinosaurs or anything like that. I asked them where they were from, not in words, yet they would not tell me. I sensed that they were deeply linked to Earth somehow. They were not like the dragons from story books, more ancient, and more 'real'. Terrifying. I thought they wanted to hurt me and I felt massive fear. It was then that my body came back. I felt it weigh me down and slump me onto my bed. The fear welled up so great that I cowered on my bed.\\r\\n\\nI noticed then that the music had changed, I could hear clanging industrial music playing, that of a Nine Inch Nails remix song. I saw the world ending to the beat of this song. Buildings turned to rubble, massive holes punched into the cities, people dying everywhere. Massive pits of dead bodies and skeletons.\\r\\n\\nI could not remember what had happened after that, but my bedroom was back, and I did not feel the fear anymore. I way laying on my stomach, staring at the darkness. The images were still in my head, and I really wanted to know who those lizard-dragon type beings were and what relation they had to earth. Yet, everything dissolved and I was on a new train of feelings. I had discovered my physical body again and began exploring the sensation of my body. I rolled and squirmed around on the carpet, and played with my hands, my hair. I watched the wonderful fractal patterns dance around my room, and in my eyelids. \\r\\n\\nI could tell that the LSD was taking its course. The peaks were done, all that was left was the coming down.\\r\\n\\nAnd this is the part that I dread the most, especially with LSD that is 'dirty'. Don't get me wrong, this was great LSD, but in terms of purity, it felt like the 'bottom barrel' left-overs. Strycnine heaven! My body ached, like it had been turned inside out and back in again. My head reeled from twisting visions and flower petal designs that over took my room. This is when I glanced at my alarm clock, which I had forgotten existed (I forgot about time itself), and noticed that I would have to go to school in about 4 hours! I panicked, but then realized that I would come down before then.\\r\\n\\nThe last hours of my experience were of a calm and resting nature. Pretty soon I was tired, worn out, like I had experienced too much in one night. Its a usual feeling after an intense trip. Like I have traversed many worlds in the span of a moment. When the sun was shining and it was about 7am, I got ready for school and tried to eat some cereal. I stared into my bowl, watching the milk and thinking about what I had seen on my journey. I felt like I knew a forbidden secret (a feeling that is most prevalent during my perception-shifting experiences), some hidden knowledge or wisdom that the rest of the world did not. Thats when I realized that those who take perception shifters are walking the path of the shaman. It is the shamans task to explore the unknown, learn the vast secrets of the universe and bring them back to our dimension. \\r\\n\\nThis turned out to be my very first 'intense' LSD experience, but it would not be the most intense, or my last.

       "4  \\nAfter a very mild and unexciting acid experience about 3 months earlier, I was not expecting anything close to what happened. I had purchased 4 tabs from a friend so that I could take more if 1 tab was not strong enough. I was supposed to meet a friend in a couple of hours and thought I had some time to kill so I found the tabs and took one. \\r\\n\\nAt first, I was watching this asinine TV show about people running into things and acting like idiots. It called Americas Funniest Videos. Normally I would leave the tv on while doing something else, but suddenly this became the funniest thing I had ever seen. I started to laugh my ass off uncontrollably at every video and could not stop even when my roomate came in. One thing that made it very uncomfortable was that I had not warned my roomates beforehand that I had taken acid and found it very difficult to explain once I was on it, so I just kept trying to avoid them, but that was very hard considering how small our apartment is. Also considering I would keep staring at them and smile which they probably found to be very creepy.\\r\\n\\nSo I was watching the television show, still partly in reality, thinking that this acid must be the mild kind without any hallucinations. Then my eyes settled on the fan that was rotating. There was a light source emanating from the center and the colors became like water, swirling and melting from blue to light blue to white. I was surprised that I was hallucinating and stood up and the entire room became wavy and I felt a bit motion sick. I hobbled to the bathroom with my arms out in front of me and looked in the mirror. I could see my face and it was huge. My flesh was sort of moving around, I felt like I was in an illustration like Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. That is actually the best explanation of what everything around me turned into. I then accidently locked myself in the bathroom and did not know how to get out. I did not want to bother my roomates or freak them out so I stayed in the bathroom for what felt like an hour and thought maybe I would have to climb out the window. I tried with the doorknob again and finally it turned and I was back in the room.\\r\\n\\nIn my mind, I thought I was going on a journey, which I guess I was, and started to pack my backpack with the supplies, laptop, camera, pencils, sketchbook, ipod, ipod speaker, jacket and brought it all to my bed. I spread everything out and opened my laptop and started playing Thelonius Monk. It was the most amazingly beautiful music I had ever heard. I sat on my bed and stared out the window at the condominiums across the street and it was so unexplainable beautiful and the lighting was incredible. Prior to this experience I had felt uncreative and uninspired living in New York because of the superficiality, my school, and the city, but at that moment I realized that the creativity and potential was inside me and all of us and I could find wonder in everything if I looked for it. I realize this all sounds incredibly cliche, but I felt so inspired and all these self revelations were coming to me and I was completely happy and at peace with myself and my abilities. I think I stared at the condominiums for about 5 hours. I cannot really remember my thoughts then, but I remember seeing the most beautiful lights and colors and patterns everywhere and the music was amazing. I also remember thinking that I could never go back to my old life again. That this had completely changed my life and I could never go back knowing what I knew now and thought I understood.\\r\\n\\nThen my laptop died and without music it became less pleasurable. I had also turned my phone to silent because I did not think I could handle talking to anyone. The friend I was supposed to meet had called and when I listened to the voicemail, I started to laugh happily and felt his presence with me. I had opened my window and the cold air was coming into my room, but every time I would shiver, waves of euphoria would flow through my body and I would look at the the lightshow and feel incredibly at peace and happy. Then I realized that I had my ipod with me and started playing Comets on Fire. It was the most intense music I had ever listened to. I went from Comets on Fire, to Volcano, to Velvet Underground, to Blue Cheer, to Jefferson Airplane, to the Wipers. I thought they must have all been on acid when they wrote the music, because it was just too perfect.\\r\\n\\nTime was totally random. I took it at 12 pm and the next time I checked my watch it was 5 pm and dark. The darkness totally intensified the available light. I could not get up and turn on the lights in the room, mostly because I became scared of my roomates and was afraid they would call the police for some reason. At the peak of the acid I was scared, and there was no one to console me except myself. I told myself that it was a journey and that it would eventually end, which helped. So I took out my notebook and started to draw with the light from my cellphone. I believe I did this for like 4 hours. Every pen stroke would light up and then go dark.\\r\\n\\nThis made me very happy to draw. Everything I drew felt like some sort of revelation and it felt like anything was possible. I felt so sure and so capable, like I had found the inner artist in myself. I felt like I had realized my potential. I felt like I was underestimating myself previously and wondered how I could not see the wonder in everything. I remember saying to myself 'why did you not realize the blinds before? they are amazing! The highlights and the shadows alone would make a great painting! I've never realized how wonderful the blinds are!' I pretty much thought shit like this about everything including the dresser.\\r\\n\\nEvery once in a while I would have to get up to go to the bathroom and it was extremely uncomfortable because I did not want to see anyone. I wanted everyone I knew to be with me and experience this new world, and was very sad that they could not see what I was seeing. I was in another universe/dimension and at some point could not distinguish between reality and the trip. I thought the trip had become reality and that I would never go back. Around 10 pm, I was tired, my eyes were tired, and the trip would not end. I sort of wanted it to end, and was uncomfortable because I had been laying in my bed for 10-11 hours at that point without food, water, or any interaction. I could not go outside because of my roomates and did not want to talk to anyone.\\r\\n\\nIt ended around 3 in the morning, and I waited until my roomates were in bed and I went to the bathroom and ate some food and sat on the couch for a while. I then realized that there was writing all over my body and could not remember when or how it got there. One thing that was written was 'The laughing mocks me', I have no idea what that means. I also looked at my notebook and it looked like another person had written all over it. I finally went to sleep for about 4 hours and had to wake up at 9 to go to class. I felt totally out of it. I could not interact with anyone, and felt like I was not stable and could not hold anything. I could not really focus on anything and my eyes kept darting from one person to the next. But I felt like a different person. I was totally sure and at peace with myself. I did not wear any makeup or care, because I felt like I had transcended all of that. I realize this sounds very cliche and retarded, but I felt like I could finally see the beauty and potential of every human being. How much potential I had. How limited we all are.\\r\\n\\nI knew though that I could never do acid in my apartment again. I had to do it where there is a bigger space and a canvas set up with art supplies. I would want to do it alone I think, I do not think I could handle someone else tripping out next to me. I couldn't do it without music either. Yesterday when I was off of it, but still had some feelings left, I wanted to get back to reality, and never thought I would get back there, but now I am back in reality and I want to experience it again. I probably will do half a tab next time. LSD took me to someplace I could never conceive of and showed me how far I can push my senses. It was a really intense experience, and words can never explain what happened. I did not even try to explain it to anyone afterwards because I couldn't.

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nA normal weekend, other than the rare and sudden call from a friend who could obtain those mushrooms I was always looking for. I let most of my friends have first dibs on the stuff and then I just kept what was left over. My friends had described heavy trips off of very small doses of this certain strain. Most of the friends taking doses of around 2 grams or less.\\r\\n\\nIt was a normal monday night, bowling league night for my place of work, a few coworkers and a manager making up the remainder of the team. I sit at home after taking a shower and getting ready for the night at hand. The remainder of the mushrooms were sitting on my desk and I had intended on taking some for the night of bowling. I knew I had about 7.5 grams left and I didn't want to really have to deal with having them in my possession any longer than I already had. I save a gram and a half for one of my team members and pour the remaining 6 grams onto my desk and prepare to consume. I start to eat them, downing them with a handy soda. Typical mushroom taste and stomach feeling. And then it is time to leave. **Disclaimer: Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of any mind altering substance is extremely dangerous and is probably not a good idea (of course it took this experience to realize the severity of that claim)**\\r\\n\\n[Erowid Note: \\nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] \\n\\nI take off down the highway for my about 20-30 minute trip to the bowling alley. When I get closer to the alley I notice and extreme increase in the amount of lights that are usually around that area of town. I'm driving and thinking that I feel really good, but there is a slow realization that this is just the beginning of something huge.\\r\\n\\nI arrive at the bowling alley, still climbing, but rapidly. I go into the bowling alley, and there are visuals abound, morphing of designs and colors, and they are the most intense visuals I have ever seen (so far at least). I find my teammates and tell the non-manager ones what I have consumed just to keep them in the know.\\r\\n\\nAt this point I had gone to get a large lemonade and had settled down in a good seat. We luckily had to bowl against a ghost team, which would likely lessen the possible problems that my state of mind might cause. I start to become overwhelmed with anxiety. I have always had the anxiety before the peak of mushroom trips, but this time it was more intense and was actually frightening me at one point. I was convinced that I couldn't handle being in a public place and I kept telling my teammates that I was going to go home, which would have actually been the worst idea. \\r\\n\\nAt this point I am experiencing ever increasing visuals (like seeing myself drinking out of a pool of lemonade whenever I took a drink from my beverage), and feel that I am on the verge of a panic attack. I'm slowly realizing that there is nothing I can do to stop what is coming, and I finally give up my mental fight of control.\\r\\n\\nThis is the gateway into my real trip, my peak where all of this has been leading up to. I would say there was about 2 hours in between me eating the mushrooms initially and the peak. My mind loses its attachment from reality and I am plunged into a very intense, long, and spiritual journey. The way I rationalize my mental state is the following:\\r\\n\\nIf you think of your mind in two parts, the part that controls yourself in the real world, and your unconscious. I believe that I, the normal controller of my physical body was plunged into the world of my unconscious and the physical body was controlled by the unconscious and was able to function in a minimal fashion. Later talks with my bowling team mates said I bowled normally, but didn't talk to any of them expect for random illegible comments throughout the night.\\r\\n\\nAnyways, the visuals were intense yet intermittent. I would be bowling a frame, and I would see a few different things. First I would see other people bowling, but at the end of their approach they would go into slow motion and everyone would slowly turn their heads and stare very deeply into my eyes. Other times I would be bowling a frame, and I would see nobody in the bowling alley, keep in mind that this was a pretty busy night for the bowling alley, with the league and monday night football going on. And my mind would go through these visuals multiple times throughout the whole night of bowling.\\r\\n\\nAs for what I was going through mentally. I began thinking of the universe, and I slowly started breaking down layers and layers of actual existence until I got to the lowest form of life, atoms. I went through every chemistry and physics class I had ever taken in around thirty minutes. And after thinking of all the molecular science, I went on and convinced myself, that the world we live in, the existence that I had survived in for so many years, wasn't real. This was a hard thing to come to terms with for me, it was a very profound thought, and such a shock to my system. Existence was nonexistence. At this point I had probably been peaking for around 2 hours, 2 hours of no control over my own reality.\\r\\n\\nAnd bowling was over, we bowled three games and I averaged about a 150 for the night which was actually pretty normal for me at that time. I think the shock of knowing I had to leave kind of kicked me out of my mental trip. I continued to have strong visual hallucinations but I had regained control of my body in the physical realm. \\r\\n\\nMe and one of my team members decide to go to a local mexican restaurant to get some post bowling munchies. I get there and decide to order the 15 dollar order of nachos that is made for like four people, when there is only me and one friend. We get the nachos and about 3 chips in I lose interest and want to go home. Holding interest in food when I have been on mushrooms has always been a hard task for me. Other motivating factors were the heavy visuals that I was still having, seeing many other people in the restaurant with deformed faces. \\r\\n\\nI get home and continue to body trip for a few hours before falling asleep, waking up in the morning, the world is fresh and everything feels brand new.\\r\\n\\nLet me just say that this one experience, was life changing and changed the way I thought about everything from that day forth. For the people who want to know about religious and spiritual experiences, this is one of my first, and after the initial anxiety it was very very intense and good. I believe my state of mind at the beginning of the night was one of the deciding factors on the possibility of a bad trip. It was a good day and I was in positive spirits before taking the mushrooms. And if I had not been in a good mood, this could have been a very disastrous experience for my mind to go through.</td>\n",

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nBackground:\\r\\n\\nSince September of my senior year in high school, I have been experimenting with drugs both in hopes of gaining insight into my problems, interest and self-medication. It has been roughly two years since then and my list of drug exploits includes weed, shrooms, LSD, MDMA in rock form and in cut rolls, 2c-e, 25-I nbome, cocaine, a few pills (which I try to stay away from), alcohol, and a few other unimportant things not worth mentioning. Out of everything, I prefer psychedelics.\\r\\n\\nSet and Setting:\\r\\n\\nI had tripped shrooms on a number of occasions, somewhere around twenty times I believe, but had never gone any higher than 1/8. Psychedelics have always teased me in one way or another; I always feel as though Im on the edge of having a genuine psychedelic experience that is utterly life-changing and lives up to what people like Timothy Leary would describe it as, but instead only gain interesting perspective and insight. Not that that is a bad thing, but I always strive for more. So you can imagine my delight when I heard that my friend was bringing some shrooms into town (a nice surprise considering this town never gets good drugs). I had money, and decided that despite how intense it was bound to be (I personally think that shrooms are more intense than LSD), I was going to eat a whole 7 grams. We planned to leave the house we stayed in and go to a trail near campus to experience the trip in nature. My opinion is that if the earth is kind enough to give us a fruit as important as psychedelic mushrooms, we should honor it by experiencing the spirit of the earth while we trip. \\r\\n\\nThe Trip:\\r\\n\\nI bought the quarter and had somewhat low hopes for the shrooms. They didnt look very well grown compared to all the other good shrooms Ive eaten (Ive tripped on shrooms 20 something times, at least enough to consider myself well versed at the time). I later realized that the shrooms, which were black, were black because of how much bluing they had. \\r\\n\\n8:00 pm  I eat and eighth of shrooms, not expecting to feel anything for at least an hour like normal, given my somewhat high tolerance. Even good shrooms usually take a while to hit me noticeably.\\r\\n\\n8:30  I feel them, quite noticeably in fact. I cram around two more grams into my mouth. \\r\\n\\n8:45  Good God am I high. No visual distortions have occurred but I fee unutterably strange. My friends and I (one of whom has never eaten shrooms before and just ate an eighth) decide to head to the woods. \\r\\n\\n9:15  Weve hiked a good way up the trail so I decide to light up a joint. Shortly thereafter the roof of trees over our heads begins gyrating into an incredibly beautiful web of starry swirls and kaleidoscopic webbing. My friends, who have eaten less than I have, see the same thing, especially my crazily giggly friend who had never tripped before. I can tell these shrooms are very high quality. They were very smooth and had cleaner visuals than any shrooms I had eaten before.\\r\\n\\n9:30  My best friend, who was chilling at the house, calls me, furious, while Im in the woods and hits me with a load of complete BS about how even though I had bought him an eighth of shrooms the week earlier, I had told him I didnt need the money back (he was mistaken, I am poor) and that I wasnt a real friend and that I had blindsided him by leaving him out of this nights trip. Needless to say, these negative emotions began to make me feel incredibly uneasy, and I was bombarded with intense emotions. He tells me the money he just paid me back with is his, and hes incredibly pissed that he has to leave the house to come get it from me so he can have fun too. I reluctantly decide to cave and give him the money, not wanting the bad vibes to ruin what I had planned on being the most spiritual night of my somewhat hard at that point life. \\r\\n\\n9:40  We meet on the trail. He apologizes, I accept though I know hes just happy to have gotten his way. Its unimportant, I just dont want negative energy surrounding me.\\r\\n\\n9:50  I walk up the trail to find my friends but find myself alone as one of them has left the woods and the other has only journeyed deeper to find himself. At this point I am somewhat nervous. I have never eaten this many shrooms, and still upset from what just happened, and the trip is really starting to kick in. plus, Im alone in the woods and its dark. The stars begin warping and the moon is changing colors rapidly, and all around me the earth is breathing as if to tell me it is just as much a living soul as I. The negative energy starts to effect the visuals, and a tree about 200 feet up the path starts rolling towards me with furious speed. Never had visuals like that before. I decide to walk back to the house and join a friend who is tripping there alone. He also hasnt eaten shrooms before.\\r\\n\\n10:20  I make it to the house and remember that I have more shrooms and I joint that is a foot and a half long that I rolled before the trip. Life is good, Im forgetting the negative vibes. I sit to smoke the joint with my friend, whose face is blinking in every color imaginable. In the yard behind the back porch, the plants have turned into chainsaws that are bright green with intensely red blades, and are whipping back and forth. Runic symbols in what I took to be a language humans arent meant to understand sprout from everything, rends in the fabric of life itself appear and sprout kaleidoscopic patterns of stunning intricacy. Holy shit, these are good shrooms. I am having the deepest conversation I have ever had with a person Ive never met. I eat the rest of the shrooms.\\r\\n\\n10:30  The shrooms are just too intense for me. I cant even see anymore, my breathing is heavy and I am incredibly nauseous. I start to think I am going to die, so I have my friend (whose words I cannot understand or even hear) guide me to the room. I am scared but come to the realization after exploring the most intricate visuals I have ever seen (the open eye and closed eye are no different at this point) that I am in unique state that many people arent lucky enough to experience. My concept of myself disappears entirely, it is the oddest feeling. I am literally just space and time. Whats odder, even though I feel as though the universe and I are one, I enter a realm that I am not part of. The patterns are forming doorways that lead to different realms. I walk down a spiral staircase in my mind that leads to what I can only describe as Hell, and immediately leave. I interpret this as rejection of all the negative energy I have felt for the past three years. I emerge from Hell to walk into a land my friend would later describe as Valhalla. I am in the sky, walking on the air. I get the distinct impression that the gods have allowed me to come to this place, and am immensely thankful. Forests of incredible detail that look like something out of the movie Avatar sprout around my feet with every footstep. And then I come to a giant golden wall, curved inward to a single point in the center. Eyes sprout out of it. They are powerful, they can see right through me. They show me visions of the future, fill me with emotions, and communicate all sorts of things about me that gave me a whole new understanding of myself. It was unpleasant, but I was grateful. I am confronted by a large wall of intense energy, and through it I see the silhouette of what I interpret to be an elder in this godly kingdom. He begins to shout, and runes of the godly language sprout from everything around me. Six other elders join him, and they all begin to shout. When their shouts come together, they form a collective voice that speaks in a language that I have no idea how I understand, and it fills me with peace and shows me what I will do with my future. \\r\\n\\n12:00 am  I can see now, but the visuals are still insane. I am astounded by what I just experienced, and am filled with a huge amount of energy for some reason. I feel like a wolf, a master of my own being. I laugh and entertain myself reciting trippy poetry off the top of my head. My friends return from the woods. I can hardly talk coherently unless its something outlandish and trippy. The walls of the house appear to be coated in red, sweaty skin. I am still surprised by how powerful these shrooms were. The rest of the night is occupied with a seven foot bong and lying in bed unable to sleep.\\r\\n\\nIn Retrospect:\\r\\n\\nThis was the most profound experience of my life. This amount of quality shrooms is not for everyone but suffice it to say if you decide to eat this amount it will most likely be a textbook psychedelic experiencecreativity is booming, complete destruction of the ego, utterly life-changing. I am different than when I started, but I feel spiritually reborn.</td>\n",

I'm not new to this experience, and yet this one is unique enough to feel new. This is still hard to type. For some reason its hard to communicate, even through writing. \\r\\n\\nI ate about 7.5 grams of what this dude called Treasure Cove shrooms (lmao) and smoked about a gram of weed during the experience. I tripped with a good friend of mine. So we got into his apartment and shut the door behind us (didnt want his roommates to know about this) and got the shrooms out. We ate them around 9 PM (me slower than him, ha) and then I rolled up a blunt and we walked outside. I smoked and we talked as our surroundings started to flicker with unnatural movement. We went back inside and sat down and watched JonTron and I started to laugh uncontrollably. I had this feeling that I had multiple faces on my head, all with different expressions like mad laughter in one, and anger in another. My friend walked off and then I was alone. \\r\\n\\nThe walls were turning really yellow and had beautiful geometric patterns on them. I was focused on this when I heard a voice. It sounded like my own but much deeper, and negative. It was threatening to make this trip into a bad one. It threatened to take away my sanity. It threatened to expose my secrets and take away any control I had over my mind. It was really freaking me out. I closed my eyes and I saw a new world with my eyes shut. Mostly white landscape, like if grass grew white instead of green. I saw a figure and tensed up. This voice was personified just as a shadow that morphed around into humanoid shapes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I was back on Earth in the room that was previously morphing around and my friend was sitting there with me. I didnt have a problem with this voice again. \\r\\n\\nIt was getting hard to concentrate on the videos.  We started to watch some Durhamrockerz Youtube Poop (perfect for tripping for some reason",
       ") and I started to roll another blunt. I realized that I gave the lighter I borrowed earlier from his roommates back to them. They were kinda mad (I think?) about us not sharing shroom, so I didnt wanna go ask for a light. We decided to walk to the gas station. We were still coming up but the world around me was morphing and I couldnt stop laughing as we walked up the road. He started talking about some emotional things with me (I recently had a death in my life thats changed a lot of shit) and it kinda made me feel overwhelmed. I felt like Id lose my mind if I thought about the bad parts of life too hard. I started to stumble around a little bit but I didnt tell him about it so I could just make the feeling go away. I didnt want to feel too overwhelmed again. I dropped the weed on the grass and we decided wed go back for it on the way back from the gas station, so we didnt look like we dropped drugs on the ground and were looking for them. We made our descent down this grassy hill and onto the manmade cement weird structure that was the gas station, with all its buzzing. Oh lawd, here we go I said. \\r\\n\\nWe went inside and went straight to the back for a Coke Zero. We got in line and it was kinda busy in there, so we were smacked in between this Hispanic family in front of us and an entire line of people behind us. I had to be cool. I had to keep calm, no crazy laughter or faces. Oh my god the kid in front of me has most of his head shaved except for the back??? How am I not supposed to laugh at that? I start cracking a grin but its crooked because Im trying to hide my delight at what the Universe has just shown me. They FINALLY leave and I laugh a little more before hiding it again and putting my coke on the counter. Get that lighter,  I muttered as I pointed at the Bic lighters. I make eye contact with the lady behind the counter, doing her 3rd shift shit. Shes miserable and pissy. Im trying not to be too obvious but she knows. I shoot the shit with her, barely. I dont even know if all the words got out. Shes like have a good night YEP I replied as I grabbed my shit from her and walked off. Got out of that store and exploded with nervous laughter that cascaded into normal cackling. We reflected on the haircut and the entire experience with various Did you see that??? chirps and ran back up the hill and found the weed.\\r\\n\\nWe went back inside so I could finish rolling it, and it was incredibly hard this time around to roll it. It was all loosely packed, but still good. We went in the backyard next to this air conditioning unit and I started smoking. The weed was a little weird to hit because I rolled it all shitty, so I got determined and fixed it. Finally, got my smokeable blunt. The air conditioning unit kicked on as I lit the weed. I hit it and it didnt even feel like smoking. It didnt bother my lungs at all and I took these huge hits and smoked it really fast. My friend and I were peaking on our trip and the visuals were fantastic. Fractals and patterns spiraling out and turning my reality into a rainbow crystal, jagged wonderland. The trees were frigid and glass looking, their patterns repeating forever. The stars were zooming around. There was heat lighting out (wasnt just imagining that either) but somehow the stars were still out. Made for a really bizarre habitat I decided to visit that night. So my friend and I get to talking about weird shit, and I get really emotionally invested in some theory about how our money has always been based on gold and its because aliens ingested it for immortality. He was like well what about money that isnt based on gold? and I thought for a moment. I didnt really have an answer for that, except that maybe we were evolving. I couldnt shake this weird, rapidly growing feeling of an epiphany coming on. I thought Why did I cling so hard to that idea when all I can really prove is that I know nothing at all? I knew nothing, I was a speck of dirt. A tiny grain of sand on some cosmic beach, beyond time. If I knew nothing, then I am nothing. If 'I think, therefore I am' were true at all, then I was toast. I might as well not exist. The space around me started to spin, like a dizzy spell of vertigo but in another language, so to speak. This epiphany was too much. Things were about to get really insane.\\r\\n\\nMy visuals got wild, spiraling from all kinds of directions and looking jagged and sharp, but in colors so vivid they were almost new to my eyes. The fractals began to pulse along with some weird beating sensation inside of me and I noticed this strange, white light opening up from the sky behind my head. I saw it first in my peripheral vision and then it stayed as I questioned Does my friend see this too? I tried to ask him if he saw that weird light but its like I forgot how to communicate. I forgot spoken language and I couldnt convey body language either. I was still overwhelmed by the nothingness I felt from not-knowing and the white light grew brighter, and brighter, and then it filled my entire field of vision. My friend was speaking to me but his voice slowly faded out and was replaced with this loud roaring, like some kind of engine. I started to scream, but I couldnt scream with my mouth, only my thoughts. I felt little moans and murmurs come out of my mouth instead. The white light was blinding and I could see no more as something held me down. I could not get back up. It felt like if someone were to take a car tire to the back of your head and rev the engine, but the wheel was made of plasmatic white light. Then it also felt like someone or something was cleaning my brain but scrubbing too hard. Instead of the feeling of 'I'm not supposed to be here', I felt at home. This felt natural, as if some force or being was cleaning out my soul and saying 'Tsk, Tsk, look at the mess of a being you are'. It made me think of when a child wrecks their house and a parent tends to the mess, annoyed but still expressing unconditional love for their child by cleaning up after it. \\r\\n\\nI'm not sure what that force or being would be, but I could sense something there. It could've been some instinctual feeling, some 'one with the universe' thing. I felt totally merged with the flow of not just my home world, but planes I have walked. I was just another jagged turn in a fractal pattern, another crest in an endless wave. Another wellspring of thoughts, of consciousness contemplating itself. A face that blends with an infinite amount of other faces to make up the whole oneness of whatever we are, whatever the Universe is, whatever consciousness is. Nothing else mattered.\\r\\n\\nI'm dying! I cant get up and theres this roaring I hear that I cant explain! This is truly the end! I thought of how fun my life had been and I was so thankful. I had so much fun! The good definitely outweighed the bad! I know Ill try harder in the next life! and I accepted dying. Goodbye beautiful world, I thought. I braced myself but nothing, just more white light. Then, Planet Earth slowly fizzled back into my sight, as the trees in the backyard manifested themselves again. More and more of my vision came back and I realized I was holding onto the grass and dirt of the Earth beneath me. The roaring was still there and I processed more of my surroundings for what felt like forever and then the roaring stopped so suddenly, it was almost like somebody popped the bubble of whatever weird dimension I got stuck in. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. He was like Are you okay? What happened? over and over but I couldnt speak. I couldnt speak about this for a day or so in completion. I got parts out but communication really failed me, especially at first. I dont remember saying anything except Im coming back, Im coming back as my soul came back into my body and learned to speak again (or thats what it felt like",
       ") and I took a while to process everything. I looked down and saw my hands and the jeans on my legs and the rest of my body. Im a girl. I have a name",
       "yeah",
       "things came back slowly. I knew this guy next to me but it was hard to figure out exactly who he was. I couldnt remember much, I had to recollect the people I love. It wasnt too hard but it was eerie that it took any effort at all. At least I was already with someone I was extremely comfortable with. \\r\\n\\nI slowly came back and started speaking to my friend and one of the first things I remember was turning around and being like THAT! THAT RIGHT THERE! because I figured out what that roaring was. The air conditioning unit noise had been turned into some kind of cosmic mechanical roar that locked me in place in that other dimension (the white light) by its sound alone. I remember talking more but I dont remember what about. I think he was trying to get me to stay calm and explain what happened, but it was near impossible. We sat and talked for a while (still cant remember about what) and then we went inside. I was still tripping pretty hard. We started watching Malcolm in the Middle and I was in a nice place. I kept giggling at the dumbest shit. I still couldnt explain what had just happened. I was still trying to process it, but got distracted easily by shit. I had the attention span of a baby. I remember looking at the clock and it was about 2 AM. We talked into the night about various things. I had an amazing experience with him, I was so happy to get to do this. I felt so peaceful with my old friend, just chatting like we used to. Hes always been important to me but I never realized how much until this trip. \\r\\n\\nWe finished Malcolm In the Middle (it was the episode where the family goes out to dinner with Stevies family, lmao! Perfect episode!) and we started to feel the mushrooms leave us. It became easier for me to talk and remember more of what happened, but at this point it was getting late. We were yawning and we crawled into bed and went to sleep after some chatter. I slept for about 6 hours and went to work the next day after eating some lunch with my friend and dicking around at a couple of stores. Work was interesting (I work at an organic grocery store) and I felt spaced out but whole. I felt at peace for the first time in a long time. My normal social anxiety had vanished for the day at least. No HPPD or anything, and the shrooms had a very clean high similar to 1P-LSD, but shorter and with much crazier visuals. \\r\\n\\nWas an overall incredible and pleasant experience.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nTo begin, I wanted to write because I read many  Experiences, and find a lack of female perspective and experience.  And this trip was especially notable for me. Attending University in Los Angeles at 20 years old, Im writing this less than one day after the experience.\\r\\n\\nMy friend Addie* and I decided we would shroom together for the first time of our Winter Break (Just under an eighth each).  Im very careful about who I choose to shroom with because I dont think everyone is cut out to take them.  From personal experience Ive grasped that it is extremely mentally based, if a person seems too nervous, too wound up, scared or mentally not completely stable, I wont even think about shrooming with them.  Positive vibes throughout a trip are very important so we have to go into together and comfortable with each other.  Addie is a very chill girl so I knew it wouldnt be a problem.\\r\\n\\nPreparations:\\r\\n\\nIve shroomed about 8+ times now (shes tripped around 6+) and I like to be extremely prepared before I decide to cross onto the other side because once I cross over there is no turning back, and distraction from a task becomes increasingly more plausible.  \\r\\n\\nIn preparation for the trip we both decided to pack an adventure backpack.  Wed each just fill it with engaging things that we thought would be fun while tripping.  Im an art major, and shes very into art so both our backpacks were packed full of art making supplies.  In my backpack, I packed a camera, my sketchbook, art books full of pictures, candles, a bouncy ball, a blanket, and (of course) my ipod.\\r\\n\\nHer backpack contained more colored pencils, glitter, glue (and other various art making supplies) her laptop, speakers, 8 diet cokes, gummy bears and gum.  \\r\\n\\nWe knew that as soon as we actually started the trip, we may never use any of these things, but as long as I FEEL prepared, I dont go into tripping with any negative mindset of forgetting anything, or missing something.  Also, the backpack helps keep everything together so you dont end up loosing things while tripping.\\r\\n\\nT:: (1:40pm) This is the only time Ill give exact time because a promise of our trip was to avoid a clock until we were done, since all perception of time is usually lost. We decided to go to campus.  We have a very beautiful and old campus, with tons of foliage.  Its winter break so its empty on campus, and weve both tripped there before, and each time its a different, amazing experience.  \\r\\n\\nWe arrive at our first camp site as we referred to it  It was in a grassy area near a wall covered in ivy, we were under big trees that were  completely BRIGHT yellow, red and green in color (probably more so because of the shrooms) and it was about 70 out, with a slight wind.   It was an especially beautiful spot because every so often the wind would gust and it would literally rain and array of yellow, red and green leaves.  We laid out the blanket to sit down and begin our trip. \\r\\n\\nBy this time we were already starting to feel the effects.  We had the body high on the walk over, and as Addie described it, she could feel them [the hallucinations] creeping in as we sat down at our site.  We got out the computer and speakers and began to listen to the soundtrack of the trip which was the Across the Universe soundtrack.  \\r\\n\\nAcross the Universe soundtrack was always music Ive wanted to listen to while tripping, and hadnt yet, she agreed.  Music is very important on a trip because its unavoidable, whenever I am hearing music, my mood changes accordingly.  This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation. This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation. \\n\\nWe then began to create art, and we would feed off each others creations, and add.  We found leaves and glued them into our sketchbooks and drew from their random coloration as flowing inspiration.  The best thing about drawing and coloring while tripping is that you dont have to think about, every movement makes sense and comes natural, and you like it, you dont second guess your drawing, and you appreciate your creations more.  \\r\\n\\n Addie drew a comic book character.  I told her I could just SEE, and just knew he needed glitter.  We named him Senior Fancy, and his job was to spread glitter to the world, making it a better place.  Throughout our trip wed reference him and add to the story.  We added Bueno Bums as his accomplices to his glitter spreading ways.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about an assortment of deep and insightful things.  I can always tell a shroom conversation from a normal one because insightful things on shrooms are always things I never would talk about normally, although they make sense, they just dont come to mind sober.   This is one of the amazing things about shrooms, because when I sober up later, theyre still amazing ideas that I get to take with me from the trip.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about all the people in the world, and how so many of them live their life each day separately, and well never know or meet most of them.  Yet they keep living in their own world.  And we were sad that we cant just go up and talk to anyone.  And we were sad because so many people seemed so great and so nice, we felt like we were missing out.  This travesty dawned on us for a bit as we went on about existence.  Then we eventually just layed down and enjoyed looking up at the rain of color (leaves).  We took the yellow bouncy ball and threw it up into the sky and as it distanced from our hands it blended in each time with the assortment of the yellow until it came back down.  It seemed like it was all moving in slow motion.  \\r\\n\\nDuring this time we had smoked out of a one hitter about 3 or so times, which always brings on the visuals a little stronger and makes the trip even better.  We were also drinking down diet cokes, for some reason they taste amazing and the carbonation feels great in our mouths and going down into our bodies.  \\r\\n\\nWe later walked through campus and decided that we were both in the Jurassic park watching mood. For whatever reason she understood and was totally on the same page as me.  And then we started laughing wondering what about Jurassic park we liked, was it seeing people being torn up by dinosaurs?  We felt horrible about liking it, then we realized that it makes us feel better because while watching it we know no matter what happens, we will never be torn up by a dinosaur, then we decided that would be the worst death ever.\\r\\n\\nWe found a new spot on campus which was a little nook under a staircase with some really soft rocks.  And we talked about how weird it was.  Because someone actually made these rocks, theyre not naturally that smooth, and we found it odd that someones job is to make rocks smooth.  Then we noticed large gashes in some of the rocks laid together, and realized that the gashes had to have been made after they were laid there, and began to wonder, what exactly makes a gash in a rock?  Just normal random trippy talk.\\r\\n\\nThen we took out the music  again, commenced drawing.  Then all the sudden someone walks out of a door and smiles and says hi to us. He kinda laughed because Im sure we looked odd. The location on campus was really random and we were listening to beatles, drawing and it probably smelled like weed haha.  We loved that he had come into our world we felt like he was a part of it now, so we had to give him a name.  We decided he looked very elf like with his jolly beard, so we named him buddy the elf.   He came in and our of our fantasy land without even knowing it.  \\r\\n\\nWe caught a glimpse of the computers clock on accident by this time and saw that it was 4:30pm, this was the first trip that kind of felt time relative.  I think its mostly because the sun helped us, since its winter, at about 2 the sun begins to rapidly set, so it almost felt like time passed really fast, yet our experience felt like an eternity, so it kind of balanced out.  We talked about love, and The Beatles, and how there are so few men who think of such beautiful simple lyrics as they did, and how we wanted a man to think of us like that one day. \\r\\n\\nWe went to the restroom in shifts, since we had nice stuff with us, and had an entire little area set up.  And each time wed separate it was nice alone time, which I always need on a trip.  I went into the building to go to the restroom, Id never been in this building on campus, and it was AMAZING!  It was bright yellow and red and black inside, and very geometric and I was just walking through the quiet halls tripping on all the simple echoes and shapes and colors.  It just felt almost like I wasnt real, and this world wasnt real, and was all just a fantasy, and although I knew the experience partially was a fantasy, I knew this world was real.  I thought it was amazing.  \\r\\n\\nWe concluded the trip around 5:30pm we were almost completely done tripping by this point, just a little off mentally still.  We walked to get some food, went to my place played with my kitten, smoked and chilled and just drew the rest of the night.  \\r\\n\\nThe most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  The most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  I realized that I doubt myself a lot, especially my art.  This trip helped me understand that I just need to have more patience with my work and confidence in it.  I realized that I need to be more outgoing and confident with my decisions and just stop having so much doubt.\\r\\n\\nI gained the most about myself this trip which is another reason I think the experience is so important.  I think there are parts of myself and of the world that I will never completely understand.  I think our minds are almost too powerful to understand without the help of hallucinogenic to really open our minds and break down our thoughts a little slower than we normally would.  The details of life are beautiful, and mushrooms allow us to slow down and really take note, and appreciate them.  A quote from our trip its a crime that its a crime to do these things.  \\r\\n\\nWe discovered life, and the universe and how every day is a gift to us.  And how we need to stop worrying about what others think, and try and do more of what makes us truly happy.  Another plus of tripping, is we always learn more about each other, become closer, and take away memories and jokes forever.  I always tend to grow little closer with whoever I trip with.\\r\\n\\nWe laughed when we thought about ourselves sitting on a blanket drawing, listening to the beatles as a crime, we wanted to know who it was hurting.  We werent even hurting ourselves.  And while tripping we dont want to interact with others, so were definitely not interfering with anyone else. Its sad how close minded of a world weve come to live in.  But we wont let it get the best of us.  We still have our little escapes from reality.</td>\n",

It would end up being by far the most intense trip of my life. Here is my story. \\r\\n\\nMy previous trip (about a month ago) was the first time I had ever tripped alone, and I spent the bulk of the trip in my silent bedroom with my eyes covered lying in bed, although this dosage was just 2.1 grams (equivalent to 3.3 grams of P. Cubensis). I also spent most of that trip writhing and wriggling in my bed, and getting up to go to the toilet three or so times. I found that trip to be a success, given I was able to get through it without any fear or anxietya feat which I had only been able to achieve for the first time earlier this year on an even lower dose. My goal for my next trip was to do the full 3 grams, and also, to see if I could keep my body perfectly still and relaxed throughout the trip. I got this idea from listening to interviews with Martin Ball, who in his experience in administering and guiding 5meo-dmt trips, says he has observed trippers twisting their bodies into asymmetrical positions when their ego is clinging on and resisting the break-through, and encouraged his clients to try to maintain a relaxed, symmetrical body position through the tripa kind of physical way to surrender to the experience, in addition to the mental surrendering which is so crucial. So, I had a goal to spend the entire trip lying on my back in my bed with my arms lying relaxed to the sides of my torso (I also got the idea from Martin Ball that having your arms covering your chest is a defensive, protective position, and so having the chest open and exposed is further conducive to the physical surrender). \\r\\n\\nSo, I gulped down my shroom tea in about 30 seconds, got into this relaxed position in bed, covered my eyes, and began to try to get into a meditative statenoticing my thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations and observing them as they arrived and left in waves (I believe this meditation technique is called Vipassana, and I have been practicing it infrequently for 3-4 months). The crucial part of this kind of meditation is to be committed to staying stillto resist the urges to move or get up that the mind constantly generates. I was able to maintain this still position for the first 2 and a half hours of the trip. \\r\\n\\nThe come-up was fast and extremely intense. The first feelings I noticed, about 10 minutes after drinking the tea, were waves of energy and pressure that suddenly swept through my body. The sensations were kind of like heat, or a physical pushing, and they quickly started to come more frequently and more intensely. Soon after this, my first visual perceptions began, accompanied by much stronger waves of the physical energy sweeping more and more rapidly and forcefully through my body. My visuals consisted of a range of solidly-coloured (subdued fluorescent pink, green, yellow, solid black and white), tessellated, geometric shapes, rotating, stretching and contorting amongst themselves, and corresponding with the waves of physical pressure and energy sweeping through my body. As this intensified, I had the sensation that these shapes were squashing, stretching, and twisting my body and head like a baker kneading dough. I also had the sense that I was lying on a kind of operating table, looking up at these kind of alien-esque shape-entities that were crushing my body and head, then passing me onto the next set of alien-esque shape-entities to do more contorting. Although this was a very intense experience, I knew I was safe, and so I surrendered to these shape-entities and let them do whatever they wanted to me. \\r\\n\\nThis period of the trip seemed to last about 30 minutes, and eventually the intense physical waves of energy seemed to subside and the speed and ferocity of my visuals subdued. This marked the start of the main body of the trip, which was marked by a range of feelings, revelations and experiences, the order of which is difficult to recall. The first main feeling I can recall was this sense that objectivity and subjectivity were not distinct anymore. I could not really identify as an entity or a being that was separate from anything external to me. It felt as if 'being' was just this one phenomenon which encapsulated the entire gamut of possible experiencethat there was no difference between 'me' and 'not me', between what 'I did', and what 'happened to me'. My sense of agency was completely gone. The only thing I could be sure about was that something was happening. It was also quite extraordinary to comprehend that even in this incredible state, the 'volume' or 'intensity' of awareness or consciousness seemed the same as a regular sober state or the state on any kind of other drug I have experienced. There was basically the present momentwhich I was aware ofthe contents of which would evolve moment to moment, but which could never become 'more full' or 'more empty'. Even the lack of a feeling or sensation in a given moment was offset by space, which itself had the same 'volume' as any sensation or feeling that might have been there. I interpret this now as the idea that consciousness is always complete. It never needs anything more, and never has too much. It is steady and eternal. Each moment is perfect and whole regardless of its contents. \\r\\n\\nThis experience led me to begin to questionwhat am I? My ideas that I have previously always had about who I am pretty much all depended on the idea that I was distinct from the external worldthat I was an entity that interacted with things that weren't me (other people, objects etc.). Now, with the idea of my separateness from the world inaccessible, non-sensical, and incomprehensible, I had almost nothing to go off to answer my question. Who the hell am I!? \\r\\n\\nAll I could be sure of in this state, was that SOMETHING was happening. I was having thoughts, feelings, sensations, and visual and auditory perceptions. There was not 'nothing'. Quite the opposite. There was 'everything', and I started to realise that there ALWAYS HAS BEEN everything. Every single experience, thought, emotion and feeling I have ever had, which now are only accessible to me in the form of memories, 'I' had. That is to say, the only thing I can possibly be sure about is that they happened, and 'I' experienced them. What a revelation! What 'I' am, must be the very awareness or consciousness that has experienced and been witness to every single thing that has ever happened to me. I am not the 'idea' I have about who I am (one might call this the ego). That 'idea' is simply a pattern of thought that has been repeating for my entire life, and fooling me into believing in its existence and reality. What 'I' ACTUALLY am, is an awareness, a consciousness, that has existed for eternity (as far as I can perceive, given I dont remember the start of my existence), which has been the witness to my thoughts, feelings, and sense-perceptions for my entire life. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my 'idea' of who I am, doesnt really exist. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my 'idea' of who I am, doesnt really exist. I found out who I truly am, for the first time in my life. \\r\\n\\nAfter this incredible realisation, a lot of tension became released from my body that I didn't notice I was holding. I had just come face to face with my actual, true selfmy pure consciousness. I had finally broken through my mind, which had been preventing me from encountering my pure essence for my whole life. Suddenly, my experience became very soft and delicate. I had let down every single guard from my pure being and exposed my self to itself for the first time ever. It was so fragile and vulnerable. It was very cautious of letting me get close to itafraid of what might happen to it now that it had no protection whatsoever. My body had become extremely relaxed and utterly limp, perhaps it had lost tension that it had been holding onto for years, even decades. I saw my pure, vulnerable, exposed selfso shy and nervous. I realised what a profound moment this was. I was meeting my true self for the first time. I felt an immense care and love for my shy, vulnerable self. All it wanted was to love, and to be loved, and I loved it. I approached it very slowly so I could get closer to it without scaring it. I began to touch it, lovingly, caringly, slowly, making sure that it was feeling safe and comfortable with the amount of contact, which was more than had ever been made. It was a very similar experience to the most loving and caring kind of love-making, where two people are completely engaged and completely present with each other, and every move each one makes is determined by how the other receives and accepts it. My pure self was letting me meet it, letting me into its most vulnerable space, and accepting me! It embraced me. I had earned its trust, and I was able to get closer to it than anyone had ever gotten. I effectively met my self, and made love with it. It was possibly the most beautiful and powerful experience of life. \\r\\n\\nI opened my eyes and wriggled my fingers and toes around this point, and took in some deep, euphoric breaths as I reconnected to my surroundings. This was probably about 2 and half hours after consumption, and I was seeing a quadrupled kaleidoscope of my ceilingsome of the heaviest open-eye visuals I have ever had, which seemed to be a predictable level considering the profundity of what I had just experienced. I lay for a while watching the ceiling with my arms out like a starfish, breathing deeply, basking in the beauty and glory of my existence and what had just happened to me. A phrase came to my mind and I couldn't stop repeating it. 'You are your home'. What this meant to me was that no matter where you are physically, and whomever you are with, you are ALWAYS with your self. Your self is your home. You should love your self, you should get to know your self, because it is the only thing that has always been with you and always will be. To not know your self is to live a life of distraction and illusion, and to not care for and love your self is to harm your selfto disrespect your only home, your eternal home. I got out of bed and wrote on a piece of paper so I wouldn't forget these messages'You are your home', and beneath, 'YOU have been here through everything that has ever happened to you.' The second phrase I very carefully crafted to try to embody the insight I had about what my true self is in a way that I could interpret in a sober state. I intended it to cut through the 'idea of my self' (the ego) which my mind continually perpetuates, which changes and evolves in content and quality over time, in contrast to my true self (my pure consciousness/awareness), which is always steady and whole, and always has been, despite my inability to recognize it for my whole life. With the bulk of the trip over, I rode out the final couple of hours of the come-down listening to music with my housemate. \\r\\n\\nThis experience has been an enormous milestone in my personal journey, and has lent credence to many inklings I have been having since I began paying closer attention to the contents of my mind about a year ago. I never really understood how one can have a relationship with oneself so viscerally until now, and I have a renewed sense of awe for my life.</td>\n",

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nA normal weekend, other than the rare and sudden call from a friend who could obtain those mushrooms I was always looking for. I let most of my friends have first dibs on the stuff and then I just kept what was left over. My friends had described heavy trips off of very small doses of this certain strain. Most of the friends taking doses of around 2 grams or less.\\r\\n\\nIt was a normal monday night, bowling league night for my place of work, a few coworkers and a manager making up the remainder of the team. I sit at home after taking a shower and getting ready for the night at hand. The remainder of the mushrooms were sitting on my desk and I had intended on taking some for the night of bowling. I knew I had about 7.5 grams left and I didn't want to really have to deal with having them in my possession any longer than I already had. I save a gram and a half for one of my team members and pour the remaining 6 grams onto my desk and prepare to consume. I start to eat them, downing them with a handy soda. Typical mushroom taste and stomach feeling. And then it is time to leave. **Disclaimer: Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of any mind altering substance is extremely dangerous and is probably not a good idea (of course it took this experience to realize the severity of that claim)**\\r\\n\\n[Erowid Note: \\nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] \\n\\nI take off down the highway for my about 20-30 minute trip to the bowling alley. When I get closer to the alley I notice and extreme increase in the amount of lights that are usually around that area of town. I'm driving and thinking that I feel really good, but there is a slow realization that this is just the beginning of something huge.\\r\\n\\nI arrive at the bowling alley, still climbing, but rapidly. I go into the bowling alley, and there are visuals abound, morphing of designs and colors, and they are the most intense visuals I have ever seen (so far at least). I find my teammates and tell the non-manager ones what I have consumed just to keep them in the know.\\r\\n\\nAt this point I had gone to get a large lemonade and had settled down in a good seat. We luckily had to bowl against a ghost team, which would likely lessen the possible problems that my state of mind might cause. I start to become overwhelmed with anxiety. I have always had the anxiety before the peak of mushroom trips, but this time it was more intense and was actually frightening me at one point. I was convinced that I couldn't handle being in a public place and I kept telling my teammates that I was going to go home, which would have actually been the worst idea. \\r\\n\\nAt this point I am experiencing ever increasing visuals (like seeing myself drinking out of a pool of lemonade whenever I took a drink from my beverage), and feel that I am on the verge of a panic attack. I'm slowly realizing that there is nothing I can do to stop what is coming, and I finally give up my mental fight of control.\\r\\n\\nThis is the gateway into my real trip, my peak where all of this has been leading up to. I would say there was about 2 hours in between me eating the mushrooms initially and the peak. My mind loses its attachment from reality and I am plunged into a very intense, long, and spiritual journey. The way I rationalize my mental state is the following:\\r\\n\\nIf you think of your mind in two parts, the part that controls yourself in the real world, and your unconscious. I believe that I, the normal controller of my physical body was plunged into the world of my unconscious and the physical body was controlled by the unconscious and was able to function in a minimal fashion. Later talks with my bowling team mates said I bowled normally, but didn't talk to any of them expect for random illegible comments throughout the night.\\r\\n\\nAnyways, the visuals were intense yet intermittent. I would be bowling a frame, and I would see a few different things. First I would see other people bowling, but at the end of their approach they would go into slow motion and everyone would slowly turn their heads and stare very deeply into my eyes. Other times I would be bowling a frame, and I would see nobody in the bowling alley, keep in mind that this was a pretty busy night for the bowling alley, with the league and monday night football going on. And my mind would go through these visuals multiple times throughout the whole night of bowling.\\r\\n\\nAs for what I was going through mentally. I began thinking of the universe, and I slowly started breaking down layers and layers of actual existence until I got to the lowest form of life, atoms. I went through every chemistry and physics class I had ever taken in around thirty minutes. And after thinking of all the molecular science, I went on and convinced myself, that the world we live in, the existence that I had survived in for so many years, wasn't real. This was a hard thing to come to terms with for me, it was a very profound thought, and such a shock to my system. Existence was nonexistence. At this point I had probably been peaking for around 2 hours, 2 hours of no control over my own reality.\\r\\n\\nAnd bowling was over, we bowled three games and I averaged about a 150 for the night which was actually pretty normal for me at that time. I think the shock of knowing I had to leave kind of kicked me out of my mental trip. I continued to have strong visual hallucinations but I had regained control of my body in the physical realm. \\r\\n\\nMe and one of my team members decide to go to a local mexican restaurant to get some post bowling munchies. I get there and decide to order the 15 dollar order of nachos that is made for like four people, when there is only me and one friend. We get the nachos and about 3 chips in I lose interest and want to go home. Holding interest in food when I have been on mushrooms has always been a hard task for me. Other motivating factors were the heavy visuals that I was still having, seeing many other people in the restaurant with deformed faces. \\r\\n\\nI get home and continue to body trip for a few hours before falling asleep, waking up in the morning, the world is fresh and everything feels brand new.\\r\\n\\nLet me just say that this one experience, was life changing and changed the way I thought about everything from that day forth. For the people who want to know about religious and spiritual experiences, this is one of my first, and after the initial anxiety it was very very intense and good. I believe my state of mind at the beginning of the night was one of the deciding factors on the possibility of a bad trip. It was a good day and I was in positive spirits before taking the mushrooms. And if I had not been in a good mood, this could have been a very disastrous experience for my mind to go through.

       "46  \\nValhalla\\r\\n\\n[Erowid Note: \\nThe dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nBackground:\\r\\n\\nSince September of my senior year in high school, I have been experimenting with drugs both in hopes of gaining insight into my problems, interest and self-medication. It has been roughly two years since then and my list of drug exploits includes weed, shrooms, LSD, MDMA in rock form and in cut rolls, 2c-e, 25-I nbome, cocaine, a few pills (which I try to stay away from), alcohol, and a few other unimportant things not worth mentioning. Out of everything, I prefer psychedelics.\\r\\n\\nSet and Setting:\\r\\n\\nI had tripped shrooms on a number of occasions, somewhere around twenty times I believe, but had never gone any higher than 1/8. Psychedelics have always teased me in one way or another; I always feel as though Im on the edge of having a genuine psychedelic experience that is utterly life-changing and lives up to what people like Timothy Leary would describe it as, but instead only gain interesting perspective and insight. Not that that is a bad thing, but I always strive for more. So you can imagine my delight when I heard that my friend was bringing some shrooms into town (a nice surprise considering this town never gets good drugs). I had money, and decided that despite how intense it was bound to be (I personally think that shrooms are more intense than LSD), I was going to eat a whole 7 grams. We planned to leave the house we stayed in and go to a trail near campus to experience the trip in nature. My opinion is that if the earth is kind enough to give us a fruit as important as psychedelic mushrooms, we should honor it by experiencing the spirit of the earth while we trip. \\r\\n\\nThe Trip:\\r\\n\\nI bought the quarter and had somewhat low hopes for the shrooms. They didnt look very well grown compared to all the other good shrooms Ive eaten (Ive tripped on shrooms 20 something times, at least enough to consider myself well versed at the time). I later realized that the shrooms, which were black, were black because of how much bluing they had. \\r\\n\\n8:00 pm  I eat and eighth of shrooms, not expecting to feel anything for at least an hour like normal, given my somewhat high tolerance. Even good shrooms usually take a while to hit me noticeably.\\r\\n\\n8:30  I feel them, quite noticeably in fact. I cram around two more grams into my mouth. \\r\\n\\n8:45  Good God am I high. No visual distortions have occurred but I fee unutterably strange. My friends and I (one of whom has never eaten shrooms before and just ate an eighth) decide to head to the woods. \\r\\n\\n9:15  Weve hiked a good way up the trail so I decide to light up a joint. Shortly thereafter the roof of trees over our heads begins gyrating into an incredibly beautiful web of starry swirls and kaleidoscopic webbing. My friends, who have eaten less than I have, see the same thing, especially my crazily giggly friend who had never tripped before. I can tell these shrooms are very high quality. They were very smooth and had cleaner visuals than any shrooms I had eaten before.\\r\\n\\n9:30  My best friend, who was chilling at the house, calls me, furious, while Im in the woods and hits me with a load of complete BS about how even though I had bought him an eighth of shrooms the week earlier, I had told him I didnt need the money back (he was mistaken, I am poor) and that I wasnt a real friend and that I had blindsided him by leaving him out of this nights trip. Needless to say, these negative emotions began to make me feel incredibly uneasy, and I was bombarded with intense emotions. He tells me the money he just paid me back with is his, and hes incredibly pissed that he has to leave the house to come get it from me so he can have fun too. I reluctantly decide to cave and give him the money, not wanting the bad vibes to ruin what I had planned on being the most spiritual night of my somewhat hard at that point life. \\r\\n\\n9:40  We meet on the trail. He apologizes, I accept though I know hes just happy to have gotten his way. Its unimportant, I just dont want negative energy surrounding me.\\r\\n\\n9:50  I walk up the trail to find my friends but find myself alone as one of them has left the woods and the other has only journeyed deeper to find himself. At this point I am somewhat nervous. I have never eaten this many shrooms, and still upset from what just happened, and the trip is really starting to kick in. plus, Im alone in the woods and its dark. The stars begin warping and the moon is changing colors rapidly, and all around me the earth is breathing as if to tell me it is just as much a living soul as I. The negative energy starts to effect the visuals, and a tree about 200 feet up the path starts rolling towards me with furious speed. Never had visuals like that before. I decide to walk back to the house and join a friend who is tripping there alone. He also hasnt eaten shrooms before.\\r\\n\\n10:20  I make it to the house and remember that I have more shrooms and I joint that is a foot and a half long that I rolled before the trip. Life is good, Im forgetting the negative vibes. I sit to smoke the joint with my friend, whose face is blinking in every color imaginable. In the yard behind the back porch, the plants have turned into chainsaws that are bright green with intensely red blades, and are whipping back and forth. Runic symbols in what I took to be a language humans arent meant to understand sprout from everything, rends in the fabric of life itself appear and sprout kaleidoscopic patterns of stunning intricacy. Holy shit, these are good shrooms. I am having the deepest conversation I have ever had with a person Ive never met. I eat the rest of the shrooms.\\r\\n\\n10:30  The shrooms are just too intense for me. I cant even see anymore, my breathing is heavy and I am incredibly nauseous. I start to think I am going to die, so I have my friend (whose words I cannot understand or even hear) guide me to the room. I am scared but come to the realization after exploring the most intricate visuals I have ever seen (the open eye and closed eye are no different at this point) that I am in unique state that many people arent lucky enough to experience. My concept of myself disappears entirely, it is the oddest feeling. I am literally just space and time. Whats odder, even though I feel as though the universe and I are one, I enter a realm that I am not part of. The patterns are forming doorways that lead to different realms. I walk down a spiral staircase in my mind that leads to what I can only describe as Hell, and immediately leave. I interpret this as rejection of all the negative energy I have felt for the past three years. I emerge from Hell to walk into a land my friend would later describe as Valhalla. I am in the sky, walking on the air. I get the distinct impression that the gods have allowed me to come to this place, and am immensely thankful. Forests of incredible detail that look like something out of the movie Avatar sprout around my feet with every footstep. And then I come to a giant golden wall, curved inward to a single point in the center. Eyes sprout out of it. They are powerful, they can see right through me. They show me visions of the future, fill me with emotions, and communicate all sorts of things about me that gave me a whole new understanding of myself. It was unpleasant, but I was grateful. I am confronted by a large wall of intense energy, and through it I see the silhouette of what I interpret to be an elder in this godly kingdom. He begins to shout, and runes of the godly language sprout from everything around me. Six other elders join him, and they all begin to shout. When their shouts come together, they form a collective voice that speaks in a language that I have no idea how I understand, and it fills me with peace and shows me what I will do with my future. \\r\\n\\n12:00 am  I can see now, but the visuals are still insane. I am astounded by what I just experienced, and am filled with a huge amount of energy for some reason. I feel like a wolf, a master of my own being. I laugh and entertain myself reciting trippy poetry off the top of my head. My friends return from the woods. I can hardly talk coherently unless its something outlandish and trippy. The walls of the house appear to be coated in red, sweaty skin. I am still surprised by how powerful these shrooms were. The rest of the night is occupied with a seven foot bong and lying in bed unable to sleep.\\r\\n\\nIn Retrospect:\\r\\n\\nThis was the most profound experience of my life. This amount of quality shrooms is not for everyone but suffice it to say if you decide to eat this amount it will most likely be a textbook psychedelic experiencecreativity is booming, complete destruction of the ego, utterly life-changing. I am different than when I started, but I feel spiritually reborn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "47  \\n7.5 Grams of Brain-Scrubbing Shrooms!\\r\\n\\n'Waking up is an endless losing what you think you know, like a wave of destruction that leaves nothing, but what is true'\\r\\n\\nIve never tripped so hard in my life, and I've blown out my receptors and stretched the limits of my sanity. I'm not new to this experience, and yet this one is unique enough to feel new. This is still hard to type. For some reason its hard to communicate, even through writing. \\r\\n\\nI ate about 7.5 grams of what this dude called Treasure Cove shrooms (lmao) and smoked about a gram of weed during the experience. I tripped with a good friend of mine. So we got into his apartment and shut the door behind us (didnt want his roommates to know about this) and got the shrooms out. We ate them around 9 PM (me slower than him, ha) and then I rolled up a blunt and we walked outside. I smoked and we talked as our surroundings started to flicker with unnatural movement. We went back inside and sat down and watched JonTron and I started to laugh uncontrollably. I had this feeling that I had multiple faces on my head, all with different expressions like mad laughter in one, and anger in another. My friend walked off and then I was alone. \\r\\n\\nThe walls were turning really yellow and had beautiful geometric patterns on them. I was focused on this when I heard a voice. It sounded like my own but much deeper, and negative. It was threatening to make this trip into a bad one. It threatened to take away my sanity. It threatened to expose my secrets and take away any control I had over my mind. It was really freaking me out. I closed my eyes and I saw a new world with my eyes shut. Mostly white landscape, like if grass grew white instead of green. I saw a figure and tensed up. This voice was personified just as a shadow that morphed around into humanoid shapes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I was back on Earth in the room that was previously morphing around and my friend was sitting there with me. I didnt have a problem with this voice again. \\r\\n\\nIt was getting hard to concentrate on the videos.  We started to watch some Durhamrockerz Youtube Poop (perfect for tripping for some reason\n",
       ") and I started to roll another blunt. I realized that I gave the lighter I borrowed earlier from his roommates back to them. They were kinda mad (I think?) about us not sharing shroom, so I didnt wanna go ask for a light. We decided to walk to the gas station. We were still coming up but the world around me was morphing and I couldnt stop laughing as we walked up the road. He started talking about some emotional things with me (I recently had a death in my life thats changed a lot of shit) and it kinda made me feel overwhelmed. I felt like Id lose my mind if I thought about the bad parts of life too hard. I started to stumble around a little bit but I didnt tell him about it so I could just make the feeling go away. I didnt want to feel too overwhelmed again. I dropped the weed on the grass and we decided wed go back for it on the way back from the gas station, so we didnt look like we dropped drugs on the ground and were looking for them. We made our descent down this grassy hill and onto the manmade cement weird structure that was the gas station, with all its buzzing. Oh lawd, here we go I said. \\r\\n\\nWe went inside and went straight to the back for a Coke Zero. We got in line and it was kinda busy in there, so we were smacked in between this Hispanic family in front of us and an entire line of people behind us. I had to be cool. I had to keep calm, no crazy laughter or faces. Oh my god the kid in front of me has most of his head shaved except for the back??? How am I not supposed to laugh at that? I start cracking a grin but its crooked because Im trying to hide my delight at what the Universe has just shown me. They FINALLY leave and I laugh a little more before hiding it again and putting my coke on the counter. Get that lighter,  I muttered as I pointed at the Bic lighters. I make eye contact with the lady behind the counter, doing her 3rd shift shit. Shes miserable and pissy. Im trying not to be too obvious but she knows. I shoot the shit with her, barely. I dont even know if all the words got out. Shes like have a good night YEP I replied as I grabbed my shit from her and walked off. Got out of that store and exploded with nervous laughter that cascaded into normal cackling. We reflected on the haircut and the entire experience with various Did you see that??? chirps and ran back up the hill and found the weed.\\r\\n\\nWe went back inside so I could finish rolling it, and it was incredibly hard this time around to roll it. It was all loosely packed, but still good. We went in the backyard next to this air conditioning unit and I started smoking. The weed was a little weird to hit because I rolled it all shitty, so I got determined and fixed it. Finally, got my smokeable blunt. The air conditioning unit kicked on as I lit the weed. I hit it and it didnt even feel like smoking. It didnt bother my lungs at all and I took these huge hits and smoked it really fast. My friend and I were peaking on our trip and the visuals were fantastic. Fractals and patterns spiraling out and turning my reality into a rainbow crystal, jagged wonderland. The trees were frigid and glass looking, their patterns repeating forever. The stars were zooming around. There was heat lighting out (wasnt just imagining that either) but somehow the stars were still out. Made for a really bizarre habitat I decided to visit that night. So my friend and I get to talking about weird shit, and I get really emotionally invested in some theory about how our money has always been based on gold and its because aliens ingested it for immortality. He was like well what about money that isnt based on gold? and I thought for a moment. I didnt really have an answer for that, except that maybe we were evolving. I couldnt shake this weird, rapidly growing feeling of an epiphany coming on. I thought Why did I cling so hard to that idea when all I can really prove is that I know nothing at all? I knew nothing, I was a speck of dirt. A tiny grain of sand on some cosmic beach, beyond time. If I knew nothing, then I am nothing. If 'I think, therefore I am' were true at all, then I was toast. I might as well not exist. The space around me started to spin, like a dizzy spell of vertigo but in another language, so to speak. This epiphany was too much. Things were about to get really insane.\\r\\n\\nMy visuals got wild, spiraling from all kinds of directions and looking jagged and sharp, but in colors so vivid they were almost new to my eyes. The fractals began to pulse along with some weird beating sensation inside of me and I noticed this strange, white light opening up from the sky behind my head. I saw it first in my peripheral vision and then it stayed as I questioned Does my friend see this too? I tried to ask him if he saw that weird light but its like I forgot how to communicate. I forgot spoken language and I couldnt convey body language either. I was still overwhelmed by the nothingness I felt from not-knowing and the white light grew brighter, and brighter, and then it filled my entire field of vision. My friend was speaking to me but his voice slowly faded out and was replaced with this loud roaring, like some kind of engine. I started to scream, but I couldnt scream with my mouth, only my thoughts. I felt little moans and murmurs come out of my mouth instead. The white light was blinding and I could see no more as something held me down. I could not get back up. It felt like if someone were to take a car tire to the back of your head and rev the engine, but the wheel was made of plasmatic white light. Then it also felt like someone or something was cleaning my brain but scrubbing too hard. Instead of the feeling of 'I'm not supposed to be here', I felt at home. This felt natural, as if some force or being was cleaning out my soul and saying 'Tsk, Tsk, look at the mess of a being you are'. It made me think of when a child wrecks their house and a parent tends to the mess, annoyed but still expressing unconditional love for their child by cleaning up after it. \\r\\n\\nI'm not sure what that force or being would be, but I could sense something there. It could've been some instinctual feeling, some 'one with the universe' thing. I felt totally merged with the flow of not just my home world, but planes I have walked. I was just another jagged turn in a fractal pattern, another crest in an endless wave. Another wellspring of thoughts, of consciousness contemplating itself. A face that blends with an infinite amount of other faces to make up the whole oneness of whatever we are, whatever the Universe is, whatever consciousness is. Nothing else mattered.\\r\\n\\nI'm dying! I cant get up and theres this roaring I hear that I cant explain! This is truly the end! I thought of how fun my life had been and I was so thankful. I had so much fun! The good definitely outweighed the bad! I know Ill try harder in the next life! and I accepted dying. Goodbye beautiful world, I thought. I braced myself but nothing, just more white light. Then, Planet Earth slowly fizzled back into my sight, as the trees in the backyard manifested themselves again. More and more of my vision came back and I realized I was holding onto the grass and dirt of the Earth beneath me. The roaring was still there and I processed more of my surroundings for what felt like forever and then the roaring stopped so suddenly, it was almost like somebody popped the bubble of whatever weird dimension I got stuck in. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. He was like Are you okay? What happened? over and over but I couldnt speak. I couldnt speak about this for a day or so in completion. I got parts out but communication really failed me, especially at first. I dont remember saying anything except Im coming back, Im coming back as my soul came back into my body and learned to speak again (or thats what it felt like\n",
       ") and I took a while to process everything. I looked down and saw my hands and the jeans on my legs and the rest of my body. Im a girl. I have a name\n",
       "yeah\n",
       "things came back slowly. I knew this guy next to me but it was hard to figure out exactly who he was. I couldnt remember much, I had to recollect the people I love. It wasnt too hard but it was eerie that it took any effort at all. At least I was already with someone I was extremely comfortable with. \\r\\n\\nI slowly came back and started speaking to my friend and one of the first things I remember was turning around and being like THAT! THAT RIGHT THERE! because I figured out what that roaring was. The air conditioning unit noise had been turned into some kind of cosmic mechanical roar that locked me in place in that other dimension (the white light) by its sound alone. I remember talking more but I dont remember what about. I think he was trying to get me to stay calm and explain what happened, but it was near impossible. We sat and talked for a while (still cant remember about what) and then we went inside. I was still tripping pretty hard. We started watching Malcolm in the Middle and I was in a nice place. I kept giggling at the dumbest shit. I still couldnt explain what had just happened. I was still trying to process it, but got distracted easily by shit. I had the attention span of a baby. I remember looking at the clock and it was about 2 AM. We talked into the night about various things. I had an amazing experience with him, I was so happy to get to do this. I felt so peaceful with my old friend, just chatting like we used to. Hes always been important to me but I never realized how much until this trip. \\r\\n\\nWe finished Malcolm In the Middle (it was the episode where the family goes out to dinner with Stevies family, lmao! Perfect episode!) and we started to feel the mushrooms leave us. It became easier for me to talk and remember more of what happened, but at this point it was getting late. We were yawning and we crawled into bed and went to sleep after some chatter. I slept for about 6 hours and went to work the next day after eating some lunch with my friend and dicking around at a couple of stores. Work was interesting (I work at an organic grocery store) and I felt spaced out but whole. I felt at peace for the first time in a long time. My normal social anxiety had vanished for the day at least. No HPPD or anything, and the shrooms had a very clean high similar to 1P-LSD, but shorter and with much crazier visuals. \\r\\n\\nWas an overall incredible and pleasant experience.   \n",
       "48  \\nTo begin, I wanted to write because I read many  Experiences, and find a lack of female perspective and experience.  And this trip was especially notable for me. Attending University in Los Angeles at 20 years old, Im writing this less than one day after the experience.\\r\\n\\nMy friend Addie* and I decided we would shroom together for the first time of our Winter Break (Just under an eighth each).  Im very careful about who I choose to shroom with because I dont think everyone is cut out to take them.  From personal experience Ive grasped that it is extremely mentally based, if a person seems too nervous, too wound up, scared or mentally not completely stable, I wont even think about shrooming with them.  Positive vibes throughout a trip are very important so we have to go into together and comfortable with each other.  Addie is a very chill girl so I knew it wouldnt be a problem.\\r\\n\\nPreparations:\\r\\n\\nIve shroomed about 8+ times now (shes tripped around 6+) and I like to be extremely prepared before I decide to cross onto the other side because once I cross over there is no turning back, and distraction from a task becomes increasingly more plausible.  \\r\\n\\nIn preparation for the trip we both decided to pack an adventure backpack.  Wed each just fill it with engaging things that we thought would be fun while tripping.  Im an art major, and shes very into art so both our backpacks were packed full of art making supplies.  In my backpack, I packed a camera, my sketchbook, art books full of pictures, candles, a bouncy ball, a blanket, and (of course) my ipod.\\r\\n\\nHer backpack contained more colored pencils, glitter, glue (and other various art making supplies) her laptop, speakers, 8 diet cokes, gummy bears and gum.  \\r\\n\\nWe knew that as soon as we actually started the trip, we may never use any of these things, but as long as I FEEL prepared, I dont go into tripping with any negative mindset of forgetting anything, or missing something.  Also, the backpack helps keep everything together so you dont end up loosing things while tripping.\\r\\n\\nT:: (1:40pm) This is the only time Ill give exact time because a promise of our trip was to avoid a clock until we were done, since all perception of time is usually lost. We decided to go to campus.  We have a very beautiful and old campus, with tons of foliage.  Its winter break so its empty on campus, and weve both tripped there before, and each time its a different, amazing experience.  \\r\\n\\nWe arrive at our first camp site as we referred to it  It was in a grassy area near a wall covered in ivy, we were under big trees that were  completely BRIGHT yellow, red and green in color (probably more so because of the shrooms) and it was about 70 out, with a slight wind.   It was an especially beautiful spot because every so often the wind would gust and it would literally rain and array of yellow, red and green leaves.  We laid out the blanket to sit down and begin our trip. \\r\\n\\nBy this time we were already starting to feel the effects.  We had the body high on the walk over, and as Addie described it, she could feel them [the hallucinations] creeping in as we sat down at our site.  We got out the computer and speakers and began to listen to the soundtrack of the trip which was the Across the Universe soundtrack.  \\r\\n\\nAcross the Universe soundtrack was always music Ive wanted to listen to while tripping, and hadnt yet, she agreed.  Music is very important on a trip because its unavoidable, whenever I am hearing music, my mood changes accordingly.  This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation.

We found leaves and glued them into our sketchbooks and drew from their random coloration as flowing inspiration.  The best thing about drawing and coloring while tripping is that you dont have to think about, every movement makes sense and comes natural, and you like it, you dont second guess your drawing, and you appreciate your creations more.  \\r\\n\\n Addie drew a comic book character.  I told her I could just SEE, and just knew he needed glitter.  We named him Senior Fancy, and his job was to spread glitter to the world, making it a better place.  Throughout our trip wed reference him and add to the story.  We added Bueno Bums as his accomplices to his glitter spreading ways.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about an assortment of deep and insightful things.  I can always tell a shroom conversation from a normal one because insightful things on shrooms are always things I never would talk about normally, although they make sense, they just dont come to mind sober.   This is one of the amazing things about shrooms, because when I sober up later, theyre still amazing ideas that I get to take with me from the trip.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about all the people in the world, and how so many of them live their life each day separately, and well never know or meet most of them.  Yet they keep living in their own world.  And we were sad that we cant just go up and talk to anyone.  And we were sad because so many people seemed so great and so nice, we felt like we were missing out.  This travesty dawned on us for a bit as we went on about existence.  Then we eventually just layed down and enjoyed looking up at the rain of color (leaves).  We took the yellow bouncy ball and threw it up into the sky and as it distanced from our hands it blended in each time with the assortment of the yellow until it came back down.  It seemed like it was all moving in slow motion.  \\r\\n\\nDuring this time we had smoked out of a one hitter about 3 or so times, which always brings on the visuals a little stronger and makes the trip even better.  We were also drinking down diet cokes, for some reason they taste amazing and the carbonation feels great in our mouths and going down into our bodies.  \\r\\n\\nWe later walked through campus and decided that we were both in the Jurassic park watching mood. For whatever reason she understood and was totally on the same page as me.  And then we started laughing wondering what about Jurassic park we liked, was it seeing people being torn up by dinosaurs?  We felt horrible about liking it, then we realized that it makes us feel better because while watching it we know no matter what happens, we will never be torn up by a dinosaur, then we decided that would be the worst death ever.\\r\\n\\nWe found a new spot on campus which was a little nook under a staircase with some really soft rocks.  And we talked about how weird it was.  Because someone actually made these rocks, theyre not naturally that smooth, and we found it odd that someones job is to make rocks smooth.  Then we noticed large gashes in some of the rocks laid together, and realized that the gashes had to have been made after they were laid there, and began to wonder, what exactly makes a gash in a rock?  Just normal random trippy talk.\\r\\n\\nThen we took out the music  again, commenced drawing.  Then all the sudden someone walks out of a door and smiles and says hi to us. He kinda laughed because Im sure we looked odd. The location on campus was really random and we were listening to beatles, drawing and it probably smelled like weed haha.  We loved that he had come into our world we felt like he was a part of it now, so we had to give him a name.  We decided he looked very elf like with his jolly beard, so we named him buddy the elf.   He came in and our of our fantasy land without even knowing it.  \\r\\n\\nWe caught a glimpse of the computers clock on accident by this time and saw that it was 4:30pm, this was the first trip that kind of felt time relative.  I think its mostly because the sun helped us, since its winter, at about 2 the sun begins to rapidly set, so it almost felt like time passed really fast, yet our experience felt like an eternity, so it kind of balanced out.  We talked about love, and The Beatles, and how there are so few men who think of such beautiful simple lyrics as they did, and how we wanted a man to think of us like that one day. \\r\\n\\nWe went to the restroom in shifts, since we had nice stuff with us, and had an entire little area set up.  And each time wed separate it was nice alone time, which I always need on a trip.  I went into the building to go to the restroom, Id never been in this building on campus, and it was AMAZING!  It was bright yellow and red and black inside, and very geometric and I was just walking through the quiet halls tripping on all the simple echoes and shapes and colors.  It just felt almost like I wasnt real, and this world wasnt real, and was all just a fantasy, and although I knew the experience partially was a fantasy, I knew this world was real.  I thought it was amazing.  \\r\\n\\nWe concluded the trip around 5:30pm we were almost completely done tripping by this point, just a little off mentally still.  We walked to get some food, went to my place played with my kitten, smoked and chilled and just drew the rest of the night.  \\r\\n\\nThe most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  The most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  I realized that I doubt myself a lot, especially my art.  This trip helped me understand that I just need to have more patience with my work and confidence in it.  I realized that I need to be more outgoing and confident with my decisions and just stop having so much doubt.\\r\\n\\nI gained the most about myself this trip which is another reason I think the experience is so important.  I think there are parts of myself and of the world that I will never completely understand.  I think our minds are almost too powerful to understand without the help of hallucinogenic to really open our minds and break down our thoughts a little slower than we normally would.  The details of life are beautiful, and mushrooms allow us to slow down and really take note, and appreciate them.  A quote from our trip its a crime that its a crime to do these things.  \\r\\n\\nWe discovered life, and the universe and how every day is a gift to us.  And how we need to stop worrying about what others think, and try and do more of what makes us truly happy.  Another plus of tripping, is we always learn more about each other, become closer, and take away memories and jokes forever.  I always tend to grow little closer with whoever I trip with.\\r\\n\\nWe laughed when we thought about ourselves sitting on a blanket drawing, listening to the beatles as a crime, we wanted to know who it was hurting.  We werent even hurting ourselves.  And while tripping we dont want to interact with others, so were definitely not interfering with anyone else. Its sad how close minded of a world weve come to live in.  But we wont let it get the best of us.  We still have our little escapes from reality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "49  \\n'I met my true self for the first time aged 25'3 dried grams of Psilocybe Subaeruginosa (equivalent to 5 grams of Psilocybe Cubensis) while meditating in silent darkness. \\r\\n\\nLast night I decided to finally attempt the famous Terrence Mckenna '5 grams in silent darkness' trip for the first time. It would end up being by far the most intense trip of my life. Here is my story. \\r\\n\\nMy previous trip (about a month ago) was the first time I had ever tripped alone, and I spent the bulk of the trip in my silent bedroom with my eyes covered lying in bed, although this dosage was just 2.1 grams (equivalent to 3.3 grams of P. Cubensis). I also spent most of that trip writhing and wriggling in my bed, and getting up to go to the toilet three or so times. I found that trip to be a success, given I was able to get through it without any fear or anxietya feat which I had only been able to achieve for the first time earlier this year on an even lower dose. My goal for my next trip was to do the full 3 grams, and also, to see if I could keep my body perfectly still and relaxed throughout the trip. I got this idea from listening to interviews with Martin Ball, who in his experience in administering and guiding 5meo-dmt trips, says he has observed trippers twisting their bodies into asymmetrical positions when their ego is clinging on and resisting the break-through, and encouraged his clients to try to maintain a relaxed, symmetrical body position through the tripa kind of physical way to surrender to the experience, in addition to the mental surrendering which is so crucial. So, I had a goal to spend the entire trip lying on my back in my bed with my arms lying relaxed to the sides of my torso (I also got the idea from Martin Ball that having your arms covering your chest is a defensive, protective position, and so having the chest open and exposed is further conducive to the physical surrender). \\r\\n\\nSo, I gulped down my shroom tea in about 30 seconds, got into this relaxed position in bed, covered my eyes, and began to try to get into a meditative statenoticing my thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations and observing them as they arrived and left in waves (I believe this meditation technique is called Vipassana, and I have been practicing it infrequently for 3-4 months). The crucial part of this kind of meditation is to be committed to staying stillto resist the urges to move or get up that the mind constantly generates. I was able to maintain this still position for the first 2 and a half hours of the trip. \\r\\n\\nThe come-up was fast and extremely intense. The first feelings I noticed, about 10 minutes after drinking the tea, were waves of energy and pressure that suddenly swept through my body. The sensations were kind of like heat, or a physical pushing, and they quickly started to come more frequently and more intensely. Soon after this, my first visual perceptions began, accompanied by much stronger waves of the physical energy sweeping more and more rapidly and forcefully through my body. My visuals consisted of a range of solidly-coloured (subdued fluorescent pink, green, yellow, solid black and white), tessellated, geometric shapes, rotating, stretching and contorting amongst themselves, and corresponding with the waves of physical pressure and energy sweeping through my body. As this intensified, I had the sensation that these shapes were squashing, stretching, and twisting my body and head like a baker kneading dough. I also had the sense that I was lying on a kind of operating table, looking up at these kind of alien-esque shape-entities that were crushing my body and head, then passing me onto the next set of alien-esque shape-entities to do more contorting. Although this was a very intense experience, I knew I was safe, and so I surrendered to these shape-entities and let them do whatever they wanted to me. \\r\\n\\nThis period of the trip seemed to last about 30 minutes, and eventually the intense physical waves of energy seemed to subside and the speed and ferocity of my visuals subdued. This marked the start of the main body of the trip, which was marked by a range of feelings, revelations and experiences, the order of which is difficult to recall. The first main feeling I can recall was this sense that objectivity and subjectivity were not distinct anymore. I could not really identify as an entity or a being that was separate from anything external to me. It felt as if 'being' was just this one phenomenon which encapsulated the entire gamut of possible experiencethat there was no difference between 'me' and 'not me', between what 'I did', and what 'happened to me'. My sense of agency was completely gone. The only thing I could be sure about was that something was happening. It was also quite extraordinary to comprehend that even in this incredible state, the 'volume' or 'intensity' of awareness or consciousness seemed the same as a regular sober state or the state on any kind of other drug I have experienced. There was basically the present momentwhich I was aware ofthe contents of which would evolve moment to moment, but which could never become 'more full' or 'more empty'. Even the lack of a feeling or sensation in a given moment was offset by space, which itself had the same 'volume' as any sensation or feeling that might have been there. I interpret this now as the idea that consciousness is always complete. It never needs anything more, and never has too much. It is steady and eternal. Each moment is perfect and whole regardless of its contents. \\r\\n\\nThis experience led me to begin to questionwhat am I? My ideas that I have previously always had about who I am pretty much all depended on the idea that I was distinct from the external worldthat I was an entity that interacted with things that weren't me (other people, objects etc.). Now, with the idea of my separateness from the world inaccessible, non-sensical, and incomprehensible, I had almost nothing to go off to answer my question. Who the hell am I!? \\r\\n\\nAll I could be sure of in this state, was that SOMETHING was happening. I was having thoughts, feelings, sensations, and visual and auditory perceptions. There was not 'nothing'. Quite the opposite. There was 'everything', and I started to realise that there ALWAYS HAS BEEN everything. Every single experience, thought, emotion and feeling I have ever had, which now are only accessible to me in the form of memories, 'I' had. That is to say, the only thing I can possibly be sure about is that they happened, and 'I' experienced them. What a revelation! What 'I' am, must be the very awareness or consciousness that has experienced and been witness to every single thing that has ever happened to me. I am not the 'idea' I have about who I am (one might call this the ego). That 'idea' is simply a pattern of thought that has been repeating for my entire life, and fooling me into believing in its existence and reality. What 'I' ACTUALLY am, is an awareness, a consciousness, that has existed for eternity (as far as I can perceive, given I dont remember the start of my existence), which has been the witness to my thoughts, feelings, and sense-perceptions for my entire life. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my 'idea' of who I am, doesnt really exist. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my 'idea' of who I am, doesnt really exist. I found out who I truly am, for the first time in my life. \\r\\n\\nAfter this incredible realisation, a lot of tension became released from my body that I didn't notice I was holding. I had just come face to face with my actual, true selfmy pure consciousness. I had finally broken through my mind, which had been preventing me from encountering my pure essence for my whole life. Suddenly, my experience became very soft and delicate. I had let down every single guard from my pure being and exposed my self to itself for the first time ever. It was so fragile and vulnerable. It was very cautious of letting me get close to itafraid of what might happen to it now that it had no protection whatsoever. My body had become extremely relaxed and utterly limp, perhaps it had lost tension that it had been holding onto for years, even decades. I saw my pure, vulnerable, exposed selfso shy and nervous. I realised what a profound moment this was. I was meeting my true self for the first time. I felt an immense care and love for my shy, vulnerable self. All it wanted was to love, and to be loved, and I loved it. I approached it very slowly so I could get closer to it without scaring it. I began to touch it, lovingly, caringly, slowly, making sure that it was feeling safe and comfortable with the amount of contact, which was more than had ever been made. It was a very similar experience to the most loving and caring kind of love-making, where two people are completely engaged and completely present with each other, and every move each one makes is determined by how the other receives and accepts it. My pure self was letting me meet it, letting me into its most vulnerable space, and accepting me! It embraced me. I had earned its trust, and I was able to get closer to it than anyone had ever gotten. I effectively met my self, and made love with it. It was possibly the most beautiful and powerful experience of life. \\r\\n\\nI opened my eyes and wriggled my fingers and toes around this point, and took in some deep, euphoric breaths as I reconnected to my surroundings. This was probably about 2 and half hours after consumption, and I was seeing a quadrupled kaleidoscope of my ceilingsome of the heaviest open-eye visuals I have ever had, which seemed to be a predictable level considering the profundity of what I had just experienced. I lay for a while watching the ceiling with my arms out like a starfish, breathing deeply, basking in the beauty and glory of my existence and what had just happened to me. A phrase came to my mind and I couldn't stop repeating it. 'You are your home'. What this meant to me was that no matter where you are physically, and whomever you are with, you are ALWAYS with your self. Your self is your home. You should love your self, you should get to know your self, because it is the only thing that has always been with you and always will be. To not know your self is to live a life of distraction and illusion, and to not care for and love your self is to harm your selfto disrespect your only home, your eternal home. I got out of bed and wrote on a piece of paper so I wouldn't forget these messages'You are your home', and beneath, 'YOU have been here through everything that has ever happened to you.' The second phrase I very carefully crafted to try to embody the insight I had about what my true self is in a way that I could interpret in a sober state. I intended it to cut through the 'idea of my self' (the ego) which my mind continually perpetuates, which changes and evolves in content and quality over time, in contrast to my true self (my pure consciousness/awareness), which is always steady and whole, and always has been, despite my inability to recognize it for my whole life. With the bulk of the trip over, I rode out the final couple of hours of the come-down listening to music with my housemate. \\r\\n\\nThis experience has been an enormous milestone in my personal journey, and has lent credence to many inklings I have been having since I began paying closer attention to the contents of my mind about a year ago. I never really understood how one can have a relationship with oneself so viscerally until now, and I have a renewed sense of awe for my life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "18:30\r\n",
       "Upon returning to our tent the music had started and I was feeling very cool, my mind was at ease and my body felt good I had not had many visuals yet. We consumed another 3 grams of mushrooms each and 3 tabs of LSD. We decided to go explore the dance area. I could feel both the LSD and the mushrooms fighting for dominance and had to lie down. I explained to my friend dealer who I will call D from here on.  I found a soft spot and lay back. As my body hit the ground it felt as though everything was sinking in beneath me (in a good way) as waves of euphoria and that tingly acid sensation washed over my body. I have no idea how long I lay there, but I traversed time and space in my mind, I was soaring with nebulas and dancing with the cosmos. I eventually felt energetic and jumped up, a head rush followed that can only be described as my soul trying to pop out my skull. \r\n",

       "+- 21:00 \r\n",
       "I found D, after roaming around like a madman for I dont know how long. He was happy to see me and handed me 2 more tabs of acid and gave me a cap of 2c-b. I downed them all. We went for another walk up the mountains. It was pitch dark so we needed to bring a torch. The torchlight on the grass was insane it kept jumping up and dancing in the sky.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We reached the rock we had meditated at earlier and I needed to sit down as I was feeling a little woozy. As I looked around everything seemed a lot more evil than it was earlier, even Ds demeanor had changed. I asked him something and he just mumbled back. I had a sudden fear that a demon or something had dragged me here to this rock. I kept seeing flashes of blood splattered every where, and I swore I could hear myself scream. I was breathing very heavily, and D said I should sit down. He took out some MDMA and said we should sniff some to clear the bad vibes.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I sniffed 2 medium sized lines, and almost instantly felt like a purple cloud had descended on me. Everything was so happy and different to how it was not 2 minutes earlier. I could talk easier and we even hugged for a few minutes. We began talking about our lives and how him and I are so different, yet are the same people on psychedelics. I swear I could feel his thoughts at this point. I tried to explore this more but got a very sharp metallic taste in my mouth, and an intense headache. We decided we needed some water and headed back to the tent.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "01:00\r\n",
       "We are back at the tent, and there are a few other people sitting around talking to the other people we met there. I was surprised at how easy I was talking to people. Eventually D decided we should all smoke some DMT. I have only done it twice before, and was a bit unsure, but we went into the tent and he took out a pipe a lighter and a small baggie of DMT. He said I should go first. He held the pipe and lit the small amount of DMT sitting on top of some parsley looking stuff. I inhaled deeply. The first taste was the distinctly acrid plasticy taste of DMT, I almost vomited but managed to keep it all in. I exhaled, but before the smoke had even left my mouth I could feel the pull of the floor. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "The tent swirled like ice cream at a parlour and before I knew it I was engulfed in whiteness and marbled lines like the architecture of a distant world far beyond our understanding. I could hear singing/ringing everywhere. And could hear my name (although it wasnt, but I simply recognized it as my name). It was a womans voice and I tried to locate it, but there were patterns swirling everywhere in my vision, it was getting hard to focus on anything for longer than a second before it moved away. There were pulsating (not correct word, but closest to what I saw) colours everywhere, bright yellows and oranges they were changing shades and eventually I managed to move past them and was met by a massive tower like structure, the womans voice was coming from inside the tower. I tried to walk but was held back by something. The colours were fading and as I turned to see what it was the tent became clear again. I remember sitting up and I was sweating quite a bit. I relaxed for the next 10 minutes trying to understand what was going on. I tried to write down the experience, in point form but lost interest half way through.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "01:45\r\n",
       "I thanked D and left the tent to go walk around as I was leaving D shouted and asked if I wanted more drugs. I said I would take some with me in case we got separated. He gave me some more 2c-b and a capsule of MDMA. I took the 2c-b and went to the stream nearby to relax and try to think. I lay on the ground, I could hear frogs croaking, but they sounded like machines or something, I closed my eyes and focused on their croaks. They seemed to get louder until it was unbearable, I screamed and they stopped. In my head I imagined that my scream had ended everything.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I wanted to see what I had done, as it was so quiet, I could not even hear the sound of the music, only my heartbeat. Instead I decided I would re-create the world in my mind. At this point I became immersed in my own mind, I was creating the earth like a god it was swirling masses of rocks and I compacted them. I formed mountains, I flew through canyons I was carving with my mind.  All in all I was the Universe, I was God, I was The Gods, I could understand everything that had happened, everything that was to happen and why. I knew I had a place in the world, and that I was just as important as a god because I came from something resembling a god.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I gripped the grass around me tightly and ripped up handfuls of earth. The ground was cold and damp, as I made the connection to what I had done, the frogs croaking became clear again, and I opened my eyes. The first signs of dawn were clearly visible as orangey pinky glows in the distance. I washed my hands in the stream and ventured off to find D. When I found him he told me I had been gone for about 3 hours. I was surprised as I thought I had been gone about an hour tops. We relaxed at the tent and spoke to each other about a lot of shit. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "05:30\r\n",
       "We decided to go for a swim and clear our heads. I took the other MDMA cap and had another line, hoping to keep up a happy mindset as things were starting to turn nasty again. I stepped into the stream and my feet felt like they had been dipped in liquid nitrogen, the sensation persisted as I went in deeper. I washed quickly as it was freezing. While drying myself It felt like the towel was re-juvinating me while I rubbed it vigorously over my body. I felt great. I looked at D and we plodded off again. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "06:30\r\n",
       "We returned to the tent and debated trying to sleep; we decided it would be impossible. We decided however that it was now time to go dance. But not before some K. I had a small bump. It burned a little. It was beginning to take effect almost instantly as it felt like my head was expanding and floating at the same time I lay down and tried to forget about it. I noticed small clouds in the dawn light of the sky, they comforted me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "There were disturbances in my peripheral vision, there had been all night. These were different though.  I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and my head started to float away again, I looked down at my shoes and they seemed like I was looking through binoculars backwards. I immediately jumped up, wobbled and fell over again. I was kneeling with my head in my hands. I could feel my face moving further away from my head, I couldnt stop it. I was trying so hard to keep it from disappearing, I imagined myself running after it like a kid chasing a helium balloon. I cried out for D he came up and pulled me to my feet. He kept saying it would be ok, I believed him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He helped me walk to the tent. I lay there for quite some time, playing in my mind. I eventually felt good enough to stand up, but for some reason wanted more K. I had another 2 bumps and collapsed onto the bed. For the next hour I was obliterated I cant even begin to describe the things that went on in my head. The tent wasnt real, I wasnt real. Nothing was real. I watched the Universe being born and then traveled through millions of years of the Universes development in split seconds. I arrived at the exact point I was at and jolted upright. I got up and needed to go outside.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "09:00\r\n",
       "I went to dance for a bit and found D sitting playing with one of those you open and its a ball of interconnected plastic, and you close it and it like a star. He gave it to me and I danced with it. I felt so good, and could feel the MDMA slightly. I asked D for more as I was enjoying dancing so much. He gave me what was my last 2 capsules. I gobbled them up and went to sit down as I felt sick, they hit me so quickly, it couldnt have been more than 10 minutes. I jumped and danced for what must have been close to an hour. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "10:30\r\n",
       "I needed to eat even though I wasnt hungry, but I felt weak. I opted for some fruit, It didnt taste of much, but I could feel the goodness coursing thru my veins. After a fair amount of watermelon and some mango. I was ready to vomit, so I walked it off. I was feeling bouncy and lively, and danced for a short while, until my stomach started to cramp. I needed to lie down. I went to the first soft spot I had found the previous evening and lay there rubbing my stomach. It felt so good, and was helping a lot. I got up and went back to the dance floor D was gone. I went to the tent and found him sorting out shrooms to go sell. We sold shrooms and some acid for a while. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "14:00 \r\n",
       "We got back to the tent after walking around and selling the drugs. We decided the best thing to do was to eat some shrooms and veg out for the rest of the afternoon. We both ate 5 grams each and lay in the shade waiting for them to take effect. Most of the acid was still going but everything else had faded, the MDMA was still giving me very nice euphoria.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I felt the familiar leg spasms of mushrooms and the discomfort in my stomach. My vision started to go all soft and hazy, I realized my eyes were trying to close, so I closed them and voyaged into my mind again. I assumed D was going thru the same thing as he was quiet as well. I tried to delve into my mind and as I traversed the corridors of my mind it became apparent that I needed to change. I was a disgusting person, who had destroyed my life with drugs. I argued with this thought and figured it could go very awry at this point. I opened my eyes and the same evil from earlier had returned. I was freaking out, I looked at my hands and didnt believe they were mine. I looked at D lying next to me, he looked happy with a smile on his face, I was jealous I wanted to be happy. I got up and went into the tent and lay down again.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Everything was closing in on me, I could hear people laughing at me outside. The world was mocking me. I closed my eyes and tried to break through this funk. I came to the conclusion that I was feeling guilty because of all the drugs I had taken, and promised myself never to do it again. I couldnt have been very honest with myself as the feelings of anger and guilt grew stronger. D opened the tent and I almost fucking died of fright. He burst out laughing, and eventually so did I. I asked him if I could have more K to shift the focus of my trip. He obliged with 2 small bumps. I did one. The same feelings as before persisted, but they were looping in my mind, I could look at them from another perspective. I snorted the other bump and lay down again.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "This time my mind collapsed in on itself, and I forget the details, but I remember the tent vibrating and the stretcher that I was lying on felt like pillows stuffed with polystyrene chunks, I rolled onto the floor, and lay on my stomach. My stomach started growling, and mumbling I tried to listen to what it was saying, but it was obviously alien. I even tried communication but failed. I was cramping severely, and in a wave of brilliance decided my stomach was grumbling. But then it spoke almost an English word. For the next however long I was confused, angered and worried about my stomach. I think I may have fallen asleep, because when I opened my eyes the feeling of the K was almost gone. The mushrooms had mellowed out and D was nowhere to be seen.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "16:00\r\n",
       "I ate some more food and prepared myself for the mescaline and impending vomit from the come-up. At this point I was unsure of proceeding with this ludicrous weekend. D convinced me that we had gotten this close to infinity that we had to go on. We spent the rest of the afternoon talking cod shit and mellowing out.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "18:45\r\n",
       "We prepared ourselves mentally for the mescaline and I took 2 capsules which was about 500mg. We went to dance while we waited for the mescaline. I know it takes a while so I was not impatient. The shrooms were still going slightly and my visuals were pretty and soft like cotton wool spirals. We danced for about an hour, but my legs were starting to feel like lead so I sat down on a hay bail.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I could feel the mescaline coming on slowly and felt anxious. It was like waves of warmth moving through my limbs. My vision was getting sharper and I tried to focus on a piece of hay, I moved it around and it left long lasting trails. I was definitely fucked on the mescaline. As I became aware of the high, I felt sick and ran off to a tree where I vomited. After I washed my face I surveyed my surroundings. I was feeling really happy and noticed a crowd gathering near the dance floor. I went over and there was a fire dancer show starting. I sat in awe for at least 45 minutes, the flames seemed like molten gold and amber being flung around and controlled by some magical force.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I noticed D and called him over, he was well and truly high. He was also amazed at the flames and we sat talking about how it warmed our souls to see something like that. I asked one of the girls with the fire staff if I could have a go, she obliged. I focused myself and tried my best to look confident. I managed a few spins before dropping it. I returned it to her, and was quite impressed, D was laughing, as he reckons I made the dumbest faces.\r\n",

       "We both walked to the dance floor and just swayed in the awesomeness of the beats. I had to go stand next to the speaker and feel the power of the bass. The speaker set-up was 65K turbo sound rig, and was fucking loud. I pressed my back to one of the bass bins, and closed my eyes. What came next was truly amazing. It felt like I was floating. I couldnt feel the ground at all I had to open my eyes to make sure I hadnt floated off. My visuals were getting more intense and people were melting and moving to the music. I focused on one girl in particular who was dancing like she was loving life to the max. I watched her for ages, she was a goddess, a nymph, my ultimate desire.\r\n",

       "I snapped out of it and lost site of her. I had to find her I plodded off and eventually was lost near the stream, I have no idea how I had got there. I lay down as I felt I might be a little overwhelmed. I faded in and out of this reality and into the next, Orbs of good were swirling around my head, they were almost humming a peaceful tune, although I could have been doing this. I was in touch with myself, my inner beauty. I was electric, and amazing I felt like I could shoot lightning from my fingertips. I got up and had to find D to see if he was feeling amazing as well. He was at the tent.\r\n",

       "We had been chatting for ages about random things, and how psychedelics could really be the answer to a lot of the worlds problems, if anyone had ever felt like we did they would never want to harm anyone else. Let alone destroy whole countries. I had another bump of K for shits and giggles, it didnt do much apart from give me some disturbing CEVs of flashing lights and lightning.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "D asked if I wanted to hit the DMT again, I agreed. I sat on the stretcher and breathed deeply, he held the pipe to my mouth I inhaled held it and breathed out. I could feel the smoke swirling in my chest and throat, I coughed and shattered my vision, I focused on one piece at it fell to the floor it was getting closer and I was almost right on it. I kept falling and put my hand out to stop myself but was stopped by something. I saw fractals of infinite complexity, lines so thin a million of them would fit into a single strand of spider web.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I heard the womans voice from earlier, it was very distant this time. I turned and could see nothing but pulsating glowing colours and architectural fractals. I turned once more and there she was, a woman naked and dripping water/mercury. She was pure, she was beautiful. I reached for her and tried to grab her hand, it was impossible to, she moved away as I moved towards her. I was getting frustrated, she whispered the word no. I felt happy as I knew now that she was unobtainable.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly the tent was coming back and I could hear ringing in my ears. I woke up slumped on the floor. D was laughing, and said I was doing some fucked up things, like growling and shaking. I lit the pipe for him, and left the tent so he could enjoy the privacy. I couldnt believe how awesome I felt. My soul was glowing with love and peace, it came of waves of euphoria that can only described as god touching me. I thought back to the feelings I had on the mushrooms, and could understand them more clearly, they were dirty and horrible. The mescaline explained that I was not entirely ready for this weekend and that I was not to do it again as my life would indeed become dirty like those thoughts. It continued saying that I was experienced enough to do it, but that anything in excess is bad.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I felt ashamed, and the presence grew stronger. I could feel love, pain, anger, happiness, and all my emotions as one emotion it was given a word by the presence but I have forgotten it. I was told that I have a lot to give to this world and should not let the pursuit of a high stop me from being the best person I can. I agreed. I snapped out of it as D walked up behind me. He handed me another 2 capsules of mescaline and said he was going to go fuck out in the tent. I took them and decided to go do the same.\r\n",

       "I awoke out of a haze of unconscious consciousness. I have no idea how long I lay there in tent for. I cant even describe the things I had done in my mind. I looked at my watch and freaked out, I had been lying there for the whole night. I think my bodies tiredness was too much to handle. I was still very clearly fucked on the mescaline and went to watch the sunrise. I yanked D out of his sleeping bag, and we went up to the rock. He was not talkative, and neither was I but we seemed to communicate without words. We sat in awe of the sunrise. He pulled out the rest of the K and I refused any more. He had a bump and we both just sat in silence for what seemed like ages, I could see ants working, bugs doing there thing, and suddenly felt guilty about work.  Which was the next day. I put it out my mind and continued to watch things going about their comical business. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "For the rest of the morning we didnt do much apart from smoke a few joints and eat some food. D was convinced some of his soul had been stolen. I on the other hand felt like my soul had been given a second chance, another chance to be great. I told him he was being silly and that it was probably the K. He agreed, and started laughing. I said we should do it again next week jokingly, I think he almost fell off his chair, until I said it was a joke. He seemed very serious, and I was starting to feel uncomfortable. I said I was going to bathe in the stream. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "When I returned everyone was packing up, I helped and we left shortly afterwards. I was still very high in the car on the way home and watched as the scenery flitted by. I was relieved to get home, and have a shower. I felt like the shower cleansed me inside. I thought back to what the mescaline had told me and smiled. I knew I would be ok. I watched tv for the rest of the day until I fell fast asleep.\r\n",

       "Conclusion:\r\n",
       "I feel I seriously over did it, but things like this dont happen very often. I will be taking a years break from psychedelics, and hope to only do Mescaline and LSD when I start again. I came to the realization, that although psychedelics can reveal truths about myself and the world, it is still a drug, and will be used in the pursuit of a high. I vow never to look at psychedelics in this way again, and treat them with the respect they deserve.&lt;/th&gt;\n",

       "It started off as a harmless birthday party. My friends, Nic and Cat, were extremely lucky to get the flat they did. It&amp;#39;s a basement flat and an old deaf lady lives above them so she doesn&amp;#39;t hear the noise. Even the noise of approximately 40 people partying hard with the decks at full volume.\r\n",

       "I arrived at whatever time I arrived. I&amp;#39;m guessing that this was about half seven pm on the Saturday. I was one of the first to arrive, and indeed arrived before the hard-core drugs did, and before the music. So, smoking hash commences. So far it&amp;#39;s not that jumpin a party, but then our guy arrives with some speed, pills, and for some reason a bottle of acid. I&amp;#39;m not sure why he thought the liquid acid would be any good at a party with forty people. Maybe he just happened to have it on him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway, I bought a gram of speed and three pills. I took two pills and had a few lines of base while I was waiting to come up. The speed was great, and the pills were fine. I&amp;#39;m used to doing speed and pills; I do them on a semi-regularly basis just for a bit of fun. Everyone was having a fantastic time, the people who were wasted and the people who were straight (most of them were working the next day). There were people fire dancing, which just looks so amazing when you&amp;#39;re on pretty much any drug, and still looks cool when you&amp;#39;re not.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I persuaded one of my friends to let me have a go of his pois (that&amp;#39;s fire on chains). It&amp;#39;s one of the most fun things to do while off your face. I&amp;#39;d recommend it to anyone, although you should definitely have several people watching you so that if you set your clothes on fire, someone notices for you, because you won&amp;#39;t on you own! We have great photos of one of my friends totally covered in black slimy soot from the paraffin, but I digress.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The bathroom was one of the quiet rooms of the house. It&amp;#39;s a really big bathroom with lots of floor space, and lots of fucked people, for some reason, just began to congregate there. I believe it may have started off just being the bath. I have vagueish memories of sitting in the bath with other people. We talked, we occasionally danced, we smoked hash, and we were all having a great time. There were a few people (there always are at big parties) who were a lot more fucked than everyone else. One girl was wandering about in a daze for most of the night, speeding off her face. There was a guy there who ended up spending almost the entire night unconscious on the sofa. His head bounced spasmodically from side to side. I&amp;#39;m sure in his head he was having a fantastic time dancing away and chatting to people, but he was in fact totally monged out all night. He only opened his eyes when the music stopped (which was rarely) and just sat there looking confused for a few moments before it started up again. Everyone kept half an eye on both these people all night, and both were fine by morning.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "As the night progressed, those who were drug free left for bed. The remainder then separated into two groups. In one group were those for whom it had been enough. They&amp;#39;d either run out of drugs or were too knackered for the drugs to be working any longer. The first group was the one that I was in. We were the hardcore party animals who had been up for the whole night and decided that it would be a good idea to go and watch the sun rise. Eventually this was agreed on and we set off for the beach. It was cold and drizzling slightly. This was not a great environment for people who have been up all night on drugs. I think some of us were feeling that much more of this would simply lead to the dreaded comedown. We climbed the fence into the ruined castle, but we couldn&amp;#39;t find a part of the castle that was sheltered enough to skin up in, so we just headed back. The sky was much lighter, but the sun was still not yet up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat for a while in the living room, our remnant looking more and more depressed as the minutes passed. People skinned up and joints were created, but this was no longer enough for any of us. Then someone suggested that we all go on an acid trip. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. I&amp;#39;d done acid before, but only in very small amounts--enough for a mild trip, but no more--so I was eager to try it properly. Seven of us ended up taking a taxi to the house seven miles out of town where we could trip for six hours or so uninterrupted.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After sitting down and smoking a spliff or two, we got down to business. The guy with the acid reckoned that two drops of the liquid acid would suffice, judging on previous experience from the same bottle. There was one other person there who had never taken a big dose of acid. We agreed to keep an eye on each other. We were all experienced drug users, and expected just to have a laugh and ignore the hideous comedowns that had set in until we could sleep them off a bit later in the day. I don&amp;#39;t actually remember what it tasted like now, but I remember discussing it at the time.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "So that was it; the deed was done. All we could do now was wait. I remember wondering how long it would take. We decided that the curtains should be closed. The view outside wasn&amp;#39;t very stunning, and the cold and the wet looked unpleasant, although the sky was starting to clear by then. I think it was about ten am on the Sunday, but I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat and smoked up some more, waiting, listening to music. I have no idea how long after that we actually started tripping, but I do remember sitting on the sofa looking at the ceiling, fascinated for a while before I realised that it had started. The ceiling was made of pine and was full of knotholes. I&amp;#39;m not sure what drew my eye up there, but I noticed that some of the dark knots had started to move around the ceiling. I pointed this out to everyone, and soon we were all there.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It&amp;#39;s amazing how quickly time passed and how far things degenerated. We spent a long time sitting and chattering amongst ourselves. My brain turned to putty and I kept saying things that I didn&amp;#39;t mean to say. It wasn&amp;#39;t that I didn&amp;#39;t want to say them, it&amp;#39;s just that my train of thought started coming out my mouth. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop stating really obvious things like &amp;#39;The sky is blue&amp;#39; and asking really mundane questions. It made people laugh and it was interesting to see what the LSD had done to my brain.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Going to the toilet turned out to be a bit of an adventure. That sounds slightly wrong, but it really was. I&amp;#39;d been in the same room the whole time and hadn&amp;#39;t even tried walking or standing. When I did get up to go after a few hours of sitting on the floor, it was like trying to walk on the moon. My depth perception was fucked, and I could watch my legs bending and stretching out and shrinking and folding. It was great! As I hadn&amp;#39;t left the room before, I didn&amp;#39;t know what the rest of the house was like. I was very confused. There were stairs everywhere. Some of the staircases were really narrow and long. Others were wide, but only had three or four steps. I was very confused at the time. I couldn&amp;#39;t decide whether or not I was hallucinating all these stairs. There seemed to be a set between every single room. I later on confirmed that this was the case. The house we were in had been built upon an old ruin and started off very small with bits and pieces being added over the years. It was a fantastic house for a trip. In the toilet on the window ledge there were some ornamental shells. There appeared to be lots and lots of spider web just on that shelf and nowhere else. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was real or not, but the spiders kept me from investigating further.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Back in the main room, the knots in the ceiling had turned into beetles and were running all around, but this was ok as the ceiling was where they &amp;#39;belonged&amp;#39; and I intuitively knew that they would stay up there. I had a brief look outside the curtains, but the alien landscape outside was a bit daunting, so I decided to leave it alone. The joint-making had suddenly become very bad indeed. Everything looked wrong. All the dimensions were warped. I tried rolling some cigarettes, and that was difficult enough. It took an enormous amount of concentration. The result of five minutes&amp;#39; work looked extremely strange. Anything we rolled always seemed too short, but the length of the skins hadn&amp;#39;t changed. It was a bit of a mystery. Smoking itself was great fun though. Occasionally it was hard to work out if we&amp;#39;d ashed the carpet by mistake or if something had fallen off the end of the spliff or roll-up, but usually after checking the carpet nothing had. Watching the smoke curl and float about was fantastic. At times it looked solid and so real, but then my perception would shift again slightly and I&amp;#39;d see infinitely deeply into the smoke and out the other side. It&amp;#39;s a difficult thing to describe, but it was mesmerising.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After maybe four or five hours of this, one of us received a phone call to say that their flat was being inspected. The poor guy who had been phoned had absolutely no idea what to do. We were all far too fucked to be of any help cleaning up the flat. That was our first stress. I remember looking at the clock at that point to check how long it was until the flat inspection was supposed to occur. This was almost impossible. At one point the three different hands on the clock ticked in three different directions, even though there are only two directions (clockwise and anticlockwise) possible and only one direction they were made to go in. I realised at that point that my brain was fucked enough to be creating three dimensions out of two-dimensional object. I decided that now would be my best chance ever of imagining a hyper-cube (a four-dimesional cube for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know), or better yet--as three dimensional representations of four-dimensional cubes are almost possible, making them easier to picture--a hyper-sphere would be really really impressive. I spent about five minutes doing this. My brain boggled and came close to leaking out my ears. I decided it would be better just to leave it for another time. I kept being destracted by the stress of my fellow trippers.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Our second stress, and first major problem occurred at about four o&amp;#39;clock. The guy to whom the house we were in belonged received a text message from his parents to say that they were coming home early (they hadn&amp;#39;t been due back for a day) and would see him in about an hour. At this point things became really confusing for me. We managed to work out that we&amp;#39;d all have to leave. We also had to tidy up and leave no evidence of our being there. The problem was that we couldn&amp;#39;t agree on where to go. I reckoned the best place would be to go back to the party flat that we&amp;#39;d started in. It would be safe there, and people would understand our predicament and leave us to come back down to baseline. Others believed that heading for the fields to look for magic mushrooms would be a much better idea. We eventually got the place tidied up, but it took a long time and a lot of effort. People started making toast and soup, thinking that this would help in some way. The windows were opened to let the room air, but this was confusing as the wind began blowing things around. I remember some of the observations I made at the time. One that sticks out was that we had been reduced to mob mentality. A person can be intelligent, but people are stupid. We were like people, I realised. Not just seven people. We were more like 700 all trying to do the same task. We got in each other&amp;#39;s way, we drifted about aimlessly, and we did things that didn&amp;#39;t need to be done. Eventually we got organised enough to think properly about leaving and where to go. I remember being really proud of our achievement at this time. I decided that we were like different facets of the same mind. We had had a goal, and we had achieved it. We&amp;#39;d done what we set out to do, and somehow the idea of a hive-mind seemed agreeable to me at the time. We were just deciding that it would be a good idea to get in a taxi back to town when a taxi pulled up outside. After a moment&amp;#39;s conference we discovered that someone had already phoned one and forgotten about it completely.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Just a quick note here: at the time I didn&amp;#39;t know that we were tripping more heavily and for longer than we&amp;#39;d intended. It was my first time taking this much acid, so I thought that this was all going to plan, except of course the early return of parents. I was very happy up until the point that we left the house. There were stresses and problems, but they weren&amp;#39;t my worries. I could try and help, and just tried not to think about the fact that we had to leave the house. It made me feel a bit panicky, thinking about how we were going to get the seven miles back into town in a direction I didn&amp;#39;t know and go somewhere we hadnt&amp;#39; decided, so I just didn&amp;#39;t think about it until I had to.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It took us so long to get out to the taxi that he&amp;#39;d started to drive off, but one guy ran after it and stopped him. I have no idea what he said to convince the driver to let seven heavily-tripping people into his taxi, but it worked. I was sat in the back and the guy I was sitting next to started talking to me about stabbing a biro pen into the neck of the taxi driver to stop him telling anyone. I thought/hoped he was joking and went along with him for a bit. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell how loud we were talking though and started to worry that the driver could hear us. We got back into town and the driver asked us where in town we wanted to go. Seven different voices stated seven different destinations. The taxi driver said that he&amp;#39;d just drop us off where we were so I shouted over them all and told the driver to take us to the street the party had been on. This was where the party had started, and it seemed fitting to me that it should also end there.\r\n",

       "We were all just heading down to the original party flat, when some of us decided that the pub would be better and our local was the safest. Apparently people were thinking that if we went back to the flat we&amp;#39;d get roped into cleaning up, which, in our hallucinatory state, would not have been easy. I remember asking everyone individually if they&amp;#39;d rather go to the pub or back to a nice flat where we could chill, and only one person actually wanted to go to the pub. However, the group mind had already decided and there seemed to be no way out of it. We walked into the pub at about half past five on the Sunday evening. Thankfully it was quiet. There were only about six people there, and I knew most of them at least vaguely. Perhaps this wouldn&amp;#39;t be too bad after all. Some of us sat down, and some of us ordered drinks. I sat down and waited to see what would happen next. The general opinion seemed to be that we were going to have a drink here and then move on to the flat, but, of course, it really didn&amp;#39;t work that way.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in the pub for almost three hours. Those were the worst three hours of my life. I think that I started really coming down off the speed from the night before about then. I started getting intensely paranoid. I remember trying to interact with some of the people there, but the attempt was futile. I&amp;#39;d hear them say half of a sentence that made no sense before they descended into what seemed to me to be complete gibberish, not even speaking words.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "During those hours, I sat mulling over what course of action I should take; many thoughts crossed my mind. I considered killing everyone, or myself, or screaming at everyone to stop fucking with my mind. Words can&amp;#39;t express that experience. I know now what a bad trip is be like, but I would still do it again. I was actally in hell for what felt like days. However, I pride myself on the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t completely freak out. On the inside, I completely fell apart, but outwardly I was fine. I was told that my eyes were as big as saucers the whole time I was there, and my sober friends could tell that all was not well, but I didn&amp;#39;t completely break down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My thoughts were running in circles. Random thoughts were going through my head that I had no real control over. I felt my mind fracture and splinter, and it was such an effort just to keep myself in the seat, but on the other hand, I felt that I couldn&amp;#39;t leave everyone else because I would then be truly alone and I was scared. I was terrified that I wouldn&amp;#39;t recover and that I&amp;#39;d spend the rest of my life in this living hell. I felt so small and fragile. I honestly contemplated suicide and murder, and for a while I actually did think that I was already dead and that this was hell.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I don&amp;#39;t know how bad that was, but I do know that things could have gone a lot worse. If I had lost my self control, I honestly would completely have freaked out. I had a long time to think about many things. I don&amp;#39;t know whether or not the conclusions that I made during that time are correct or not, but I do know that I learned a lot about myself and the way my mind works. I survived.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I could tell myself that this was something beyond my control, that the tripping would stop at somepoint, and that everything would be normal again. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it would have been better if I&amp;#39;d left the pub or not. I do know that I couldn&amp;#39;t though. I had to stay with the other tripping people. I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to face the world on my own. I became extremely insecure.\r\n",

       "At several points, I could feel my mind fracture and spin off in different directions. It was a bit like the clock from before. The clock whose hands went in three different directions. I had more than one train of thought running at once. It&amp;#39;s an extremely bizarre feeling. I couldn&amp;#39;t focus on anything for more than a few seconds...literally. I don&amp;#39;t know how many times I asked when we were going to head back to the flat, but I think it was quite a lot.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I remember feeling me trying to hide within myself, that is, my self awareness or my consciousness was retreating deeper and deeper. I think that this was some kind of defense mechanism. I was trying to get away from what I was experiencing, but I couldn&amp;#39;t physically get out, only hide myself mentally. At the time, I thought that this might be how some patients at mental hospitals must live. It frightened me to realise just how much acid can fuck a person up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I&amp;#39;m giving up on trying to describe this properly. I can&amp;#39;t even remember it clearly and I really can&amp;#39;t find the words to convey what it was like. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to some of the people that were in the pub at the time. I wanted to find out how much they had been trying to fuck with us, and it turned out not to be that much at all. I could have sworn that half of the time I was there, people were trying to mess with our minds. That, however, was just my mind messing with me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Having experienced this though, I&amp;#39;d still say that acid is a really fun drug to use, but in future I&amp;#39;m going to treat it with a bit more respect and caution. I know that I have a tendency to rush into things without really thinking the consequences through properly, but at the same time I have an excellent capacity to look after myself.\r\n",

       "I spent over a week dazed and confused from that experience. I later learned that our dosage had been misjudged. The fact that we&amp;#39;d been up all night partying hard and taking other drugs was not taken into account and what was supposed to be a mild six-hour trip became a twelve hour epic adventure. This is an experience that I will never ever forget, and something that I hope I can really learn from. I know that I have already gained a lot of knowledge about myself. I know it&amp;#39;s a bit of an acid cliche, but it&amp;#39;s one of those cliches that you really don&amp;#39;t appreciate until you&amp;#39;ve been through it yourself. It takes a lot of strength to face yourself on a hellish introspective acid trip-gone-wrong. It&amp;#39;s definitely not something that I wanted to experience, but I&amp;#39;ve done it and in a way I&amp;#39;m glad that I have.\r\n",

On the whole I reckon it really was a positive experience and it&amp;#39;s definitely not put me off trying acid again in the future. I&amp;#39;m not really sure what that says about me as a person, but once again I don&amp;#39;t really care. I&amp;#39;m happy being who I am.&lt;/th&gt;\n",

I was greeted by my &amp;#39;Mom and Dad&amp;#39;, my &amp;#39;mom&amp;#39; with a big hug as soon we pulled into the camp site and she blasted &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m your mom for the weekend and Mic is your dad!&amp;#39; Mom was very drunk by this point (I was under-age and I needed somebody over 18 to ensure I&amp;#39;d be okay) and she soon says, I can do drugs but I just have to be safe about it (water, rest, food etc). She guided my friend to his parking spot for the weekend which was hilarious, she was yelling and bossing C (my friend) to basically have the perfect park job!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mic (&amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;) came to the site of my passenger door where I was sitting. He shook my hand for like 10-20 seconds, which seemed like a very long handshake. He had been trying to intimidate me for fun I believe. I was a little sketched out but in the end he was one of the nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That night I met everybody. I&amp;#39;m a rather shy person so I didn&amp;#39;t say much to them. My friend and I tried to set up the tent ASAP because night was starting to fall and I needed a place to sleep. After struggling and failing for about an hour, night finally fell and we decided to just give up and that I would sleep in the van for the night. \r\n",

My friend soon went to go to bed in the van while I stayed out and talked with my friends. My new friend R, packed a hookah and told me to start smoking, so I did. Later we eventually put hash into the bowl and it was great! \r\n",

Dragon replies with &amp;#39;not a good answer&amp;#39;. So she pulls out this white powder with a little spoon like thing and takes out a little powder on it and holds it out for her BF to snort. At this point I was like &amp;#39;wtf is going on here?!&amp;#39; in my head. Somebody soon asks what was it and she replies &amp;#39;ketamine&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;d never even heard of it before so I asked asked and it sounded intense. \r\n",

       "One of the DJs had been camping with us (I didn&amp;#39;t realize til he was on stage) and he was asking for drugs from anybody. Dragon pulls out the ketamine and the DJ asks if he can have some. She pulls out a hit for him and he smells it like a flower. He soon replies still snorting with his nose &amp;#39;What was that by the way?&amp;#39; I thought that it was crazy and hardcore that he didn&amp;#39;t even know what he had done til after. I soon went to bed after.\r\n",

       "First thing in the morning my friend and I finally set up the tent. I had brought two hits of acid and planned on doing one of them later in the day and my friend C would do one as well. We went to where they were setting up stages and just sat in the shade for a long time. My friend was trying to make me take my acid early (it was 2PM) and I wanted to do it at about 5 or 6 so I would be able to be awake all night no problem. After arguing for about 30 - 60 minutes about when to take it I told him I took it at about 2:30 (I didn&amp;#39;t take it yet). He said he would take it an hour and a half after I did. We walked back to camp, I was pretending to be feeling it a little. Then eventually headed back to the music.\r\n",

       "On the way to the music we smoked a bowl of weed and that&amp;#39;s when I snuck the LSD into my mouth (about 3:30 pm? I had no track of time this whole thing so I&amp;#39;m guessing). He then took his about 30 minutes later. We walked down to the little pond thing and crossed the bridge. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were reunited with some of our fellow campers and a bunch of others. I told them I was on acid and they were all like nice, we have to get some for ourselves too. This is where I started to trip balls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had packed about 2 more bowls and passed it around. I felt a shift in atmosphere but I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what exactly was changing. Eventually we left the people I didn&amp;#39;t really know and it was the campers and I. We moved closer to the music and some went back to camp to look for LSD. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "They all came back saying they took their acid and we just marinated on the grass by the main stage, staring at things, intrigued with how everything looked more beautiful and how everything had been starting to melt. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "It was eventually just a girl and I together somehow and we just lay by each other, discussing everything we see and what&amp;#39;s happening in each others minds. This seemed to be one of the most epic things and I felt really connected to this girl. We laid and stared at trees. Things had seemed to be blooming. Trees would grow outwards and then blossom with flowers on the tips, and then those flowers would slowly blossom towards me!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We eventually went and sat on the the other side of the pond thing where we were pretty much secluded from everybody but could still see everything. We still lay and sit there chatting about the usual.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon later, my friend K, had run up to us with a water gun and two kids about 7 years old who both had water guns. They started chasing us and shooting us with water guns. This was a little irritating considering I was not in the mind set to deal with kids. But it took a quick turn around. It soon felt like I was a kid again, it was exactly like playing tag when I was in elementary school! Being chased around by the 3 people was one of the most coolest experiences to happen at the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P (the girl I felt connected with), C, and I started to book it back to the campsite which had to be about 3 or 4 football fields away. The kids were still chasing us!! And they managed to keep up some how. I was outstanded, thrilled and a little scared too. These kids were on a mission and it was to get us wet!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The kids caught up to us and finally used up all their water after about an hour! It was a terrific accomplishment finally being able to sit and just enjoy.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By now I was just starting to peak and I had been tripping out so hard! I sat by my new friend R, who was giving me advice on how to take an acid trip. While he was explaining I remember just looking up at the trees, and things changed color and texture for a brief about 5 seconds. In this little while I had forgotten who I was.  R is one of the smartest people I know and have met! He has the best advice anybody has ever given me. It&amp;#39;s unbelievable!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had experienced a bad trip before, and I told him I experienced an &amp;#39;ego death&amp;#39; which he later told me was &amp;#39;Ego Freedom&amp;#39;. He was saying stuff like, if you start to have a bad trip just remember, that its like sitting in a canoe going down a river. All you need to do is tell yourself that and you&amp;#39;ll be fine. What ever you see going down that river will eventually be behind you and don&amp;#39;t let one bad idea spiral into a nightmare. He also said that LSD is a big head game with yourself, sure you can be with other friends but when it comes down to it, its just you, within your mind! I was so stoked on how smart R was and how great of a friend I made him this festival!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He eventually went to the stage where I just laid on the blanket outside on our site and just tripped out for awhile. Trees and other nature were still blooming and blossoming before my eyes. As well the world had began to feel like I was a cartoon living in a cartoon world. Nothing looked, or seemed real in the slightest. My reality was shattered. Later heading back to the music where I met up with P again. Night had fallen I believe. It&amp;#39;s hard to remember everything - I was tripping balls. Then I seemed to lose everybody but P, so we were together the entire night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We started to dance and I was loving it. She soon says she doesn&amp;#39;t want to dance so I said we can go for a walk and chill. The both of us walked and went on an adventure on a random path.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I held her hand on the way there. She looks at me and says &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;re you doing?&amp;#39; (Something like that, I&amp;#39;m unsure.) I apologize instantly and realize she doesn&amp;#39;t want anything. While walking she eventually grabs my hand about 10 minutes later. I was surprised and didn&amp;#39;t know what to think.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Ends up we walked around the whole camp site and ended back up at the main desk/pond. We found a really nice spot to lay down and look at the stars and the ravers in the distance. She tells me how it&amp;#39;s weird, she said she&amp;#39;s usually one of the ravers just going to the music.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I still relaxing on the grass. Enjoying the music and the comfort of each other, gazing into the stars. We realize dark clouds are slowly drifting on top of us. I suggest that a storm may be coming possibly.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Everything had become very calm, cool and still. It was the calm before the storm. The storm seemed like a hurricane on the prairies! I&amp;#39;ve never seen so much rain fall in my life. P and I decided to go sit under a tree thinking we could wait out the storm, but it just got worse and worse. The storm was raining through all the trees and we were getting soaked! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We decided to go up the stairs by the main office where it was dry. While on the way up to the stairs we found L, a friend/camper! He had done acid for his first time and was also very drunk, he was hysterical! Upon walking up the stairs, which had literally looked like a water fall now, flowing like niagra falls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "At the top, soaked. L says &amp;#39;so is the party over&amp;#39; I couldn&amp;#39;t hold back but to laugh! He was standing in the rain, in a puddle, under a gutter!! He could not have gotten anymore wet, he was using the gutter as if it were a shower and was dancing in the puddle.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The storm had eventually passed and we went to go check the aftermath of the storm. The main stage had been demolished. I was super bummed! It was such a dope stage! We eventually went back to the spot where we had been sitting. And there was an enormous tree branch that had fallen as well as many other small ones! Just about 2 meters away, that is crazy!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I go to sit on the big stair by the pond and star gaze again. We see a star that looks significantly different from all the rest. Both of us begin talking, suggesting that its a UFO, P starts to cry out of joy and confusion and amazement. I feel incredibly connected to her. We were both in the same mind set, thinking we were seeing one of the wonders of the world. After about an hour or 2 of watching this star. We finally come to the realization that its a planet and it looks so different because its reflecting the sun!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Feeling kind of tired, I tell P and she says she has MDMA we could have. I thought that it was a great idea so we headed back to camp. The stage was working now, but there was no visuals at the time. We grab a bunch of MDMA. 3 of us snort some of it (my first time snorting it). K also snorted some (friend/camper). We had also grabbed some alcohol to drink.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally arriving at the main stage, about an hour or two from sunrise, we begin to dance. I see a lot of familiar faces on the dance floor. Such as R! He had a 7 foot stick with an inflatable heart at the top of it. This looked so fucking epic and awesome! I loved it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had entered a trance where there was no way I could stop dancing! Soon doing more MDMA. My memory is a little foggy after this. But I remember I danced till sunrise. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "4 others and I headed back to camp to grab a blanket and go to the pond to watch the sun rise. Quickly coming to the realization that we are all tired and want to sleep. We went back to home (camp) and slept.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 3\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Not too much happened during the day. I talked with everybody about last evening. There was now an awkwardness between P and I for some unknown reason which remained the rest of the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Also I took R&amp;#39;s heart he had on his stick and held it to me, later suggesting that it would be cool to tape it to my chest! Which we instantly did, I felt like I belonged there now. The heart symbolizing connection between everyone which is how I felt the festival was!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That day I talked about shrooms to everyone and was unsure if I should try them as I had not done the before. I asked R for advice and he said I should try them. So I went and got 1 gram of Chocolate covered mushrooms.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By this point I was shit-faced! Shortly after, I ate the mush. It put the entire thing in my mouth. It was way too much to handle in one bite, but I managed to chew it down anyway. It was a thick dry milk chocolate and you could taste the mushrooms very slightly, it was although it was eating chocolate with nuts in it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We headed to the dance floor. I was feeling a slight shift in my reality. Once again, I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what it was! We walked as a big group down. I was walking beside R. I was chatting with him saying how he&amp;#39;s so smart and gives the best advice! I asked if I could call him my shaman, as that is how I felt about him, anything I wondered or needed to know, he knew! Even when I didn&amp;#39;t ask. He replied with yes and I was super stoked!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "On arrival I drink a bit of my alcohol that I brought with me to the dance. I was definitely still wasted and now tripping a little bit from shrooms. After losing almost everybody except C I was bummed out and decided to sit by the pond. I felt like passing out; I was not having a good time. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I pretty much sat around for an hour or two alone until the alchohol wore off so I actually felt amazing after! Colors simply looked out of this world. It was like I had been color blind and I was seeing colors for the first time ever, colors were simply beautiful! I also has a huge body stone, which felt a bit like MDMA but my body felt more numb. I was still once again looking for others! I could not find ANYBODY! I did not know what to do and I was panicking a bit. But soon came to the realization that I can always meet new friends and just enjoy life! They had also redone the stage and it was as good as new! The stage once again looked phenomenal!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "This concept was a bit difficult for me usually as I am a shy person, but when I was on mushrooms, drunk, and high from weed. It came as though it was a natural gift I soon possessed. I went to the very front of the speakers and started to dance. I had practiced shuffling before, but once again! It just came naturally now.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was having the best time of my life! I had become the music. I felt as though everybody was my family and that we were all at harmony! I danced for a couple hours till I finally found some people I knew from camp.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had not had water the whole time and I was soaking wet with sweat! I saw R and one of the first words that came out of my mouth was, water! He reacted as fast as he could to get my water. I was amazed at this simple but yet amazing gesture! I soon told him what was happening and he said we should go sit down and relax as I had been over heating. We had very intellectual conversations. He was telling me how he used to have a drug problem and how he is as a person.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He said he&amp;#39;s terrific at helping others out with their problems but when it comes to his own, sometimes he struggles deeply. I was shocked as he was one of the smartest and nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met. He told me that J had been his shaman, like he was to me (a girl who we were camping with). He was trying to say I understand what you&amp;#39;re going through and I&amp;#39;m there for you bro. R eventually says that kids usually fuck up with drugs, but I can handle it really well and that he wants to go into big brothers big sisters. I felt incredible for him and I encouraged him to do it! Even I wish I could have him for a big bro. He wants to show kids that fuck up with drugs that you don&amp;#39;t need to take 9 pills to have a good time or 12 grams of shrooms. It just takes a little. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "After out heart to heart talk, he had the brilliant idea that we should put the inflatable heart on my back and not my chest because it gets in the way of dancing , especially dancing with girls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon after doing so I started dancing again. I asked him for tips on trying to find a girl there as I couldn&amp;#39;t find one I was attracted to! Once again, it came as no surprise, he gave the greatest advice ever!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "R told me to just go find a spot where I was comfortable, close my eyes and just let the music do its part, just lose myself within the music. And when I open my eyes, I&amp;#39;d lock eyes with a girl and everything would be great. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Oddly enough, I did exactly as he said, and guess what!? I locked eyes with a girl and we soon began dancing with each other! She was one of the cutest girls at the whole thing, a little raver girl wearing a mini skirt, furry boots, bikini top, and a cat hat that looked really sexy! I was shocked at how good of advice R gives, like, it&amp;#39;s insane! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was feeling euphoric for probably one of the first times ever. It felt like absolutely everybody was my best friend and that there was no ice to break. This was a little odd to me because I&amp;#39;m a shy timid person around new people, especially adults. It was the greatest feeling I&amp;#39;ve ever felt! I cannot even explain how terrific this felt. Just feeling the love of everybody, at complete unity and peace with one another as human beings! I&amp;#39;d smile at somebody, they&amp;#39;d smile back. I was shuffling and almost instantly I found other shufflers around me, shuffling with me! It was incredible and unreal. I almost could not believe this was happening. I was shuffling in sync with others and we would take turns, I truly discovered what it was like to lose your ego at this point. I didn&amp;#39;t care what anybody looked like but only the connection we shared. It legitimately felt like everybody was at one huge family at a reunion!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After dancing the night away, most of the crowd had disappeared into the fog of the night. I told J (the girl I had been dancing with) that I was tired. She instantly concurred with me and I asked if we should head back. We started to head back and I asked what she did tonight. She had done acid and smoked weed which was cool and would have been a blast as well.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got to my tent where we went in to the tent and there was no way we were going to sleep. After dancing with her all night, I felt connect and incredibly attracted to her, there was no holding back. I soon found us having sex! The sex was incredible. It&amp;#39;s inevitable to explain how great everything was. I didn&amp;#39;t have a single worry in the world and I could not be happier!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 4 (final day of music)\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Later that morning I saw J leave but I was still asleep. I woke up later that morning thinking to myself I&amp;#39;d never see her again and I was kind of bummed as she was from the same city I was and I thought we could have been friends.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had bought more shrooms for the night today and I still had an entire vial of MDMA. Not too much happened during the day so I&amp;#39;m going to skip to night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That night I took the mushrooms and took about an eighth of the MDMA which isn&amp;#39;t a lot but it seemed to do wonders! I&amp;#39;d like to start off by saying I have never been higher in my life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I took the mushrooms and right after parachuted the MDMA. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to expect as this was the first time I had ever &amp;#39;hippie flipped&amp;#39;. I started to feel a shift in reality as usual. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had arrived to the dance floor and everything began to look amazing. The lights looked mesmerizing. The bass from the music became my heartbeat. My body was feeling numb but at peace. I had the giggles like I want a young baby and I felt butterfly like feelings inside my stomach which in turn made me smile and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop! Things started to look like they were from a 3D pop out book. I remember I walked by this tree a ton and it just looked more and more different every time. It just seemed to POP out at me! This had been the greatest I have felt in my entire life! I don&amp;#39;t remember a point in the night where I was not smiling. I was the happiest person in the world!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Dancing for an hour or so. I began to wonder if I would see J again that night. I asked R what I should do and he said something like &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t fuck a different chick man, make her your temple&amp;#39;. As he had never given me bad advice, I had no choice but to listen! He had also told me to go up behind her and smack her ass and say &amp;#39;damn I had a good time last night&amp;#39; and walk away. It would&amp;#39;ve been hilarious to do that, but it was too vulgar for me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After a quick water break with R, my eyes finally spotted J on the other site of the rave. The colors still looking magnificent and everything seeming surreal, I strutted my way across to J not knowing what to expect. I came up behind her and was greeted instantly with a huge grin, with a big bear hug. I was stoked that things were going really well!\r\n",

       "My &amp;#39;parents&amp;#39; had soon come to us and they stole J from me like a bunch of ninjas. They only took her a couple meters away, but I could hear what they were saying. They told her they were my parents and she had the most confused look on her face I&amp;#39;ve ever seen! She was absolutely clueless. While D (a guy from another camp, who had tried acid for the first time) had given me an enormous hug and said &amp;#39;man, I fucking love you!&amp;#39; This was fucking great! Euphoria is really indescribable but this is one of the closest examples that had happened there! That night he had been going up to everybody he knew and did the exact same thing to them, he had even tried to kiss &amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;! Anyways. I was reunited with J after having a big group photo, which seemed like a family portrait! I haltingly explained that they weren&amp;#39;t my parents and that they were just saying that because they assumed responsibility over me. She kind of understood but I re-explained it to her later.\r\n",

       "We continued to dance like our lives depended on it. I literally had people from my camp running up to me to give me water and gum. I loved how they were so concerned for me, it made me feel like the greatest person in the world.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "A little while after, J asks me if I want to smoke a bowl. I yelled &amp;#39;sure!&amp;#39; On the way out of the dance area, I saw R, and I have him an epic high five. It was so epic it seemed like it had created a shock wave. We went to the big open field where lazers and trippy images on the screens were. We smoked and I offered J and her friend some MDMA because I had more than plenty. Her friend said no because she had to drive tomorrow. I loaded the MDMA onto a Kleenex for J. We had still been passing the pipe around smoking like chimneys. I was incredibly high. The music was incredibly different and sounded like it was the best thing my ears have ever listened to. As well as colours just looked a lot more vibrant and incredible! She took the MDMA and said &amp;#39;thanks for the MDMA&amp;#39;. We then sat there for about 20 minutes. During this time, we had begun cuddling in the middle of the field, soon leading to us kissing, and then making out. Soon enough we were going all out. I had even started to touch in inappropriate places, she then said something which I&amp;#39;m unclear of but all I know is she wanted me to stop.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We soon went back to the music and dancing again. Still feeling incredibly euphoric and all the effects as before, if not even stronger than before. I felt really connected to this girl, as if she was my girlfriend. After dancing for about 30 minutes or so. We went back to sit down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting for a little bit I turned to J as we were cuddling and said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m tired&amp;#39; because I started to get tired and my legs were KILLING me as I had been dancing for hours and hours every day. She replied saying &amp;#39;me too&amp;#39;. I then raised the question &amp;#39;do you want to head back?&amp;#39; and she said &amp;#39;sure&amp;#39;. It was still dark out and I&amp;#39;m thinking this was about 4 am in the morning. \r\n",

       "We arrived at my tent which was about a ten minute walk and both went in comfortably. This is the latest I had arrived to my tent all weekend and I was kind of excited to go to sleep early. Little did I know, I soon found us having sex. It was the best sex I have ever had in my life. I could definitely still feel the effects of the drugs. I could literally feel the bass from my tent, which gives you an idea of how loud the music really was. Touching felt AMAZING and sex, well, I can&amp;#39;t begin to explain how great it felt!! It was ten times better than usual! After going at it for awhile and getting comfortable. I realized that it is very difficult to orgasm while on ecstasy/mushrooms, I knew this because I had noticed the sun was coming up and the music turned off (music turns off at 6 am) and we were still having sex, while she finally began to orgasm around this time. We had eventually stopped, not because of one another having an orgasm, but instead because we were really sweaty and exhausted! After soon falling asleep together too tired to put clothes back on.\r\n",

We consumed another 3 grams of mushrooms each and 3 tabs of LSD. We decided to go explore the dance area. I could feel both the LSD and the mushrooms fighting for dominance and had to lie down. I explained to my friend dealer who I will call D from here on.  I found a soft spot and lay back. As my body hit the ground it felt as though everything was sinking in beneath me (in a good way) as waves of euphoria and that tingly acid sensation washed over my body. I have no idea how long I lay there, but I traversed time and space in my mind, I was soaring with nebulas and dancing with the cosmos. I eventually felt energetic and jumped up, a head rush followed that can only be described as my soul trying to pop out my skull. \r\n",

       "We reached the rock we had meditated at earlier and I needed to sit down as I was feeling a little woozy. As I looked around everything seemed a lot more evil than it was earlier, even Ds demeanor had changed. I asked him something and he just mumbled back. I had a sudden fear that a demon or something had dragged me here to this rock. I kept seeing flashes of blood splattered every where, and I swore I could hear myself scream. I was breathing very heavily, and D said I should sit down. He took out some MDMA and said we should sniff some to clear the bad vibes.\r\n",

       "I sniffed 2 medium sized lines, and almost instantly felt like a purple cloud had descended on me. Everything was so happy and different to how it was not 2 minutes earlier. I could talk easier and we even hugged for a few minutes. We began talking about our lives and how him and I are so different, yet are the same people on psychedelics. I swear I could feel his thoughts at this point. I tried to explore this more but got a very sharp metallic taste in my mouth, and an intense headache. We decided we needed some water and headed back to the tent.\r\n",

       "We are back at the tent, and there are a few other people sitting around talking to the other people we met there. I was surprised at how easy I was talking to people. Eventually D decided we should all smoke some DMT. I have only done it twice before, and was a bit unsure, but we went into the tent and he took out a pipe a lighter and a small baggie of DMT. He said I should go first. He held the pipe and lit the small amount of DMT sitting on top of some parsley looking stuff. I inhaled deeply. The first taste was the distinctly acrid plasticy taste of DMT, I almost vomited but managed to keep it all in. I exhaled, but before the smoke had even left my mouth I could feel the pull of the floor. \r\n",

       "The tent swirled like ice cream at a parlour and before I knew it I was engulfed in whiteness and marbled lines like the architecture of a distant world far beyond our understanding. I could hear singing/ringing everywhere. And could hear my name (although it wasnt, but I simply recognized it as my name). It was a womans voice and I tried to locate it, but there were patterns swirling everywhere in my vision, it was getting hard to focus on anything for longer than a second before it moved away. There were pulsating (not correct word, but closest to what I saw) colours everywhere, bright yellows and oranges they were changing shades and eventually I managed to move past them and was met by a massive tower like structure, the womans voice was coming from inside the tower. I tried to walk but was held back by something. The colours were fading and as I turned to see what it was the tent became clear again. I remember sitting up and I was sweating quite a bit. I relaxed for the next 10 minutes trying to understand what was going on. I tried to write down the experience, in point form but lost interest half way through.\r\n",

       "I thanked D and left the tent to go walk around as I was leaving D shouted and asked if I wanted more drugs. I said I would take some with me in case we got separated. He gave me some more 2c-b and a capsule of MDMA. I took the 2c-b and went to the stream nearby to relax and try to think. I lay on the ground, I could hear frogs croaking, but they sounded like machines or something, I closed my eyes and focused on their croaks. They seemed to get louder until it was unbearable, I screamed and they stopped. In my head I imagined that my scream had ended everything.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I wanted to see what I had done, as it was so quiet, I could not even hear the sound of the music, only my heartbeat. Instead I decided I would re-create the world in my mind. At this point I became immersed in my own mind, I was creating the earth like a god it was swirling masses of rocks and I compacted them. I formed mountains, I flew through canyons I was carving with my mind.  All in all I was the Universe, I was God, I was The Gods, I could understand everything that had happened, everything that was to happen and why. I knew I had a place in the world, and that I was just as important as a god because I came from something resembling a god.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I gripped the grass around me tightly and ripped up handfuls of earth. The ground was cold and damp, as I made the connection to what I had done, the frogs croaking became clear again, and I opened my eyes. The first signs of dawn were clearly visible as orangey pinky glows in the distance. I washed my hands in the stream and ventured off to find D. When I found him he told me I had been gone for about 3 hours. I was surprised as I thought I had been gone about an hour tops. We relaxed at the tent and spoke to each other about a lot of shit. \r\n",

       "05:30\r\n",
       "We decided to go for a swim and clear our heads. I took the other MDMA cap and had another line, hoping to keep up a happy mindset as things were starting to turn nasty again. I stepped into the stream and my feet felt like they had been dipped in liquid nitrogen, the sensation persisted as I went in deeper. I washed quickly as it was freezing. While drying myself It felt like the towel was re-juvinating me while I rubbed it vigorously over my body. I felt great. I looked at D and we plodded off again. \r\n",

It burned a little. It was beginning to take effect almost instantly as it felt like my head was expanding and floating at the same time I lay down and tried to forget about it. I noticed small clouds in the dawn light of the sky, they comforted me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "There were disturbances in my peripheral vision, there had been all night. These were different though.  I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and my head started to float away again, I looked down at my shoes and they seemed like I was looking through binoculars backwards. I immediately jumped up, wobbled and fell over again. I was kneeling with my head in my hands. I could feel my face moving further away from my head, I couldnt stop it. I was trying so hard to keep it from disappearing, I imagined myself running after it like a kid chasing a helium balloon. I cried out for D he came up and pulled me to my feet. He kept saying it would be ok, I believed him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He helped me walk to the tent. I lay there for quite some time, playing in my mind. I eventually felt good enough to stand up, but for some reason wanted more K. I had another 2 bumps and collapsed onto the bed. For the next hour I was obliterated I cant even begin to describe the things that went on in my head. The tent wasnt real, I wasnt real. Nothing was real. I watched the Universe being born and then traveled through millions of years of the Universes development in split seconds. I arrived at the exact point I was at and jolted upright. I got up and needed to go outside.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "09:00\r\n",
       "I went to dance for a bit and found D sitting playing with one of those you open and its a ball of interconnected plastic, and you close it and it like a star. He gave it to me and I danced with it. I felt so good, and could feel the MDMA slightly. I asked D for more as I was enjoying dancing so much. He gave me what was my last 2 capsules. I gobbled them up and went to sit down as I felt sick, they hit me so quickly, it couldnt have been more than 10 minutes. I jumped and danced for what must have been close to an hour. \r\n",

       "I needed to eat even though I wasnt hungry, but I felt weak. I opted for some fruit, It didnt taste of much, but I could feel the goodness coursing thru my veins. After a fair amount of watermelon and some mango. I was ready to vomit, so I walked it off. I was feeling bouncy and lively, and danced for a short while, until my stomach started to cramp. I needed to lie down. I went to the first soft spot I had found the previous evening and lay there rubbing my stomach. It felt so good, and was helping a lot. I got up and went back to the dance floor D was gone. I went to the tent and found him sorting out shrooms to go sell. We sold shrooms and some acid for a while. \r\n",

I kept falling and put my hand out to stop myself but was stopped by something. I saw fractals of infinite complexity, lines so thin a million of them would fit into a single strand of spider web.\r\n",

I turned once more and there she was, a woman naked and dripping water/mercury. She was pure, she was beautiful. I reached for her and tried to grab her hand, it was impossible to, she moved away as I moved towards her. I was getting frustrated, she whispered the word no. I felt happy as I knew now that she was unobtainable.\r\n",

I lit the pipe for him, and left the tent so he could enjoy the privacy. I couldnt believe how awesome I felt. My soul was glowing with love and peace, it came of waves of euphoria that can only described as god touching me. I thought back to the feelings I had on the mushrooms, and could understand them more clearly, they were dirty and horrible. The mescaline explained that I was not entirely ready for this weekend and that I was not to do it again as my life would indeed become dirty like those thoughts. It continued saying that I was experienced enough to do it, but that anything in excess is bad.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I felt ashamed, and the presence grew stronger. I could feel love, pain, anger, happiness, and all my emotions as one emotion it was given a word by the presence but I have forgotten it. I was told that I have a lot to give to this world and should not let the pursuit of a high stop me from being the best person I can. I agreed. I snapped out of it as D walked up behind me. He handed me another 2 capsules of mescaline and said he was going to go fuck out in the tent. I took them and decided to go do the same.\r\n",

I looked at my watch and freaked out, I had been lying there for the whole night. I think my bodies tiredness was too much to handle. I was still very clearly fucked on the mescaline and went to watch the sunrise. I yanked D out of his sleeping bag, and we went up to the rock. He was not talkative, and neither was I but we seemed to communicate without words. We sat in awe of the sunrise. He pulled out the rest of the K and I refused any more. He had a bump and we both just sat in silence for what seemed like ages, I could see ants working, bugs doing there thing, and suddenly felt guilty about work.  Which was the next day. I put it out my mind and continued to watch things going about their comical business. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "For the rest of the morning we didnt do much apart from smoke a few joints and eat some food. D was convinced some of his soul had been stolen. I on the other hand felt like my soul had been given a second chance, another chance to be great. I told him he was being silly and that it was probably the K. He agreed, and started laughing. I said we should do it again next week jokingly, I think he almost fell off his chair, until I said it was a joke. He seemed very serious, and I was starting to feel uncomfortable. I said I was going to bathe in the stream. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "When I returned everyone was packing up, I helped and we left shortly afterwards. I was still very high in the car on the way home and watched as the scenery flitted by. I was relieved to get home, and have a shower. I felt like the shower cleansed me inside. I thought back to what the mescaline had told me and smiled. I knew I would be ok. I watched tv for the rest of the day until I fell fast asleep.\r\n",

       "Conclusion:\r\n",
       "I feel I seriously over did it, but things like this dont happen very often. I will be taking a years break from psychedelics, and hope to only do Mescaline and LSD when I start again. I came to the realization, that although psychedelics can reveal truths about myself and the world, it is still a drug, and will be used in the pursuit of a high. I vow never to look at psychedelics in this way again, and treat them with the respect they deserve.&quot;&gt;\n",

We consumed another 3 grams of mushrooms each and 3 tabs of LSD. We decided to go explore the dance area. I could feel both the LSD and the mushrooms fighting for dominance and had to lie down. I explained to my friend dealer who I will call D from here on.  I found a soft spot and lay back. As my body hit the ground it felt as though everything was sinking in beneath me (in a good way) as waves of euphoria and that tingly acid sensation washed over my body. I have no idea how long I lay there, but I traversed time and space in my mind, I was soaring with nebulas and dancing with the cosmos. I eventually felt energetic and jumped up, a head rush followed that can only be described as my soul trying to pop out my skull. \r\n",

       "+- 21:00 \r\n",
       "I found D, after roaming around like a madman for I dont know how long. He was happy to see me and handed me 2 more tabs of acid and gave me a cap of 2c-b. I downed them all. We went for another walk up the mountains. It was pitch dark so we needed to bring a torch. The torchlight on the grass was insane it kept jumping up and dancing in the sky.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We reached the rock we had meditated at earlier and I needed to sit down as I was feeling a little woozy. As I looked around everything seemed a lot more evil than it was earlier, even Ds demeanor had changed. I asked him something and he just mumbled back. I had a sudden fear that a demon or something had dragged me here to this rock. I kept seeing flashes of blood splattered every where, and I swore I could hear myself scream. I was breathing very heavily, and D said I should sit down. He took out some MDMA and said we should sniff some to clear the bad vibes.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I sniffed 2 medium sized lines, and almost instantly felt like a purple cloud had descended on me. Everything was so happy and different to how it was not 2 minutes earlier. I could talk easier and we even hugged for a few minutes. We began talking about our lives and how him and I are so different, yet are the same people on psychedelics. I swear I could feel his thoughts at this point. I tried to explore this more but got a very sharp metallic taste in my mouth, and an intense headache. We decided we needed some water and headed back to the tent.\r\n",

       "01:00\r\n",
       "We are back at the tent, and there are a few other people sitting around talking to the other people we met there. I was surprised at how easy I was talking to people. Eventually D decided we should all smoke some DMT. I have only done it twice before, and was a bit unsure, but we went into the tent and he took out a pipe a lighter and a small baggie of DMT. He said I should go first. He held the pipe and lit the small amount of DMT sitting on top of some parsley looking stuff. I inhaled deeply. The first taste was the distinctly acrid plasticy taste of DMT, I almost vomited but managed to keep it all in. I exhaled, but before the smoke had even left my mouth I could feel the pull of the floor. \r\n",

       "The tent swirled like ice cream at a parlour and before I knew it I was engulfed in whiteness and marbled lines like the architecture of a distant world far beyond our understanding. I could hear singing/ringing everywhere. And could hear my name (although it wasnt, but I simply recognized it as my name). It was a womans voice and I tried to locate it, but there were patterns swirling everywhere in my vision, it was getting hard to focus on anything for longer than a second before it moved away. There were pulsating (not correct word, but closest to what I saw) colours everywhere, bright yellows and oranges they were changing shades and eventually I managed to move past them and was met by a massive tower like structure, the womans voice was coming from inside the tower. I tried to walk but was held back by something. The colours were fading and as I turned to see what it was the tent became clear again. I remember sitting up and I was sweating quite a bit. I relaxed for the next 10 minutes trying to understand what was going on. I tried to write down the experience, in point form but lost interest half way through.\r\n",

       "I thanked D and left the tent to go walk around as I was leaving D shouted and asked if I wanted more drugs. I said I would take some with me in case we got separated. He gave me some more 2c-b and a capsule of MDMA. I took the 2c-b and went to the stream nearby to relax and try to think. I lay on the ground, I could hear frogs croaking, but they sounded like machines or something, I closed my eyes and focused on their croaks. They seemed to get louder until it was unbearable, I screamed and they stopped. In my head I imagined that my scream had ended everything.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I wanted to see what I had done, as it was so quiet, I could not even hear the sound of the music, only my heartbeat. Instead I decided I would re-create the world in my mind. At this point I became immersed in my own mind, I was creating the earth like a god it was swirling masses of rocks and I compacted them. I formed mountains, I flew through canyons I was carving with my mind.  All in all I was the Universe, I was God, I was The Gods, I could understand everything that had happened, everything that was to happen and why. I knew I had a place in the world, and that I was just as important as a god because I came from something resembling a god.\r\n",

       "I gripped the grass around me tightly and ripped up handfuls of earth. The ground was cold and damp, as I made the connection to what I had done, the frogs croaking became clear again, and I opened my eyes. The first signs of dawn were clearly visible as orangey pinky glows in the distance. I washed my hands in the stream and ventured off to find D. When I found him he told me I had been gone for about 3 hours. I was surprised as I thought I had been gone about an hour tops. We relaxed at the tent and spoke to each other about a lot of shit. \r\n",

       "05:30\r\n",
       "We decided to go for a swim and clear our heads. I took the other MDMA cap and had another line, hoping to keep up a happy mindset as things were starting to turn nasty again. I stepped into the stream and my feet felt like they had been dipped in liquid nitrogen, the sensation persisted as I went in deeper. I washed quickly as it was freezing. While drying myself It felt like the towel was re-juvinating me while I rubbed it vigorously over my body. I felt great. I looked at D and we plodded off again. \r\n",

It burned a little. It was beginning to take effect almost instantly as it felt like my head was expanding and floating at the same time I lay down and tried to forget about it. I noticed small clouds in the dawn light of the sky, they comforted me.\r\n",

       "There were disturbances in my peripheral vision, there had been all night. These were different though.  I suddenly felt very uncomfortable and my head started to float away again, I looked down at my shoes and they seemed like I was looking through binoculars backwards. I immediately jumped up, wobbled and fell over again. I was kneeling with my head in my hands. I could feel my face moving further away from my head, I couldnt stop it. I was trying so hard to keep it from disappearing, I imagined myself running after it like a kid chasing a helium balloon. I cried out for D he came up and pulled me to my feet. He kept saying it would be ok, I believed him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He helped me walk to the tent. I lay there for quite some time, playing in my mind. I eventually felt good enough to stand up, but for some reason wanted more K. I had another 2 bumps and collapsed onto the bed. For the next hour I was obliterated I cant even begin to describe the things that went on in my head. The tent wasnt real, I wasnt real. Nothing was real. I watched the Universe being born and then traveled through millions of years of the Universes development in split seconds. I arrived at the exact point I was at and jolted upright. I got up and needed to go outside.\r\n",

He gave it to me and I danced with it. I felt so good, and could feel the MDMA slightly. I asked D for more as I was enjoying dancing so much. He gave me what was my last 2 capsules. I gobbled them up and went to sit down as I felt sick, they hit me so quickly, it couldnt have been more than 10 minutes. I jumped and danced for what must have been close to an hour. \r\n",

       "I needed to eat even though I wasnt hungry, but I felt weak. I opted for some fruit, It didnt taste of much, but I could feel the goodness coursing thru my veins. After a fair amount of watermelon and some mango. I was ready to vomit, so I walked it off. I was feeling bouncy and lively, and danced for a short while, until my stomach started to cramp. I needed to lie down. I went to the first soft spot I had found the previous evening and lay there rubbing my stomach. It felt so good, and was helping a lot. I got up and went back to the dance floor D was gone. I went to the tent and found him sorting out shrooms to go sell. We sold shrooms and some acid for a while. \r\n",

       "23:00\r\n",
       "We had been chatting for ages about random things, and how psychedelics could really be the answer to a lot of the worlds problems, if anyone had ever felt like we did they would never want to harm anyone else. Let alone destroy whole countries. I had another bump of K for shits and giggles, it didnt do much apart from give me some disturbing CEVs of flashing lights and lightning.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "D asked if I wanted to hit the DMT again, I agreed. I sat on the stretcher and breathed deeply, he held the pipe to my mouth I inhaled held it and breathed out. I could feel the smoke swirling in my chest and throat, I coughed and shattered my vision, I focused on one piece at it fell to the floor it was getting closer and I was almost right on it. I kept falling and put my hand out to stop myself but was stopped by something. I saw fractals of infinite complexity, lines so thin a million of them would fit into a single strand of spider web.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I heard the womans voice from earlier, it was very distant this time. I turned and could see nothing but pulsating glowing colours and architectural fractals. I turned once more and there she was, a woman naked and dripping water/mercury. She was pure, she was beautiful. I reached for her and tried to grab her hand, it was impossible to, she moved away as I moved towards her. I was getting frustrated, she whispered the word no. I felt happy as I knew now that she was unobtainable.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly the tent was coming back and I could hear ringing in my ears. I woke up slumped on the floor. D was laughing, and said I was doing some fucked up things, like growling and shaking. I lit the pipe for him, and left the tent so he could enjoy the privacy. I couldnt believe how awesome I felt. My soul was glowing with love and peace, it came of waves of euphoria that can only described as god touching me. I thought back to the feelings I had on the mushrooms, and could understand them more clearly, they were dirty and horrible. The mescaline explained that I was not entirely ready for this weekend and that I was not to do it again as my life would indeed become dirty like those thoughts. It continued saying that I was experienced enough to do it, but that anything in excess is bad.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I felt ashamed, and the presence grew stronger. I could feel love, pain, anger, happiness, and all my emotions as one emotion it was given a word by the presence but I have forgotten it. I was told that I have a lot to give to this world and should not let the pursuit of a high stop me from being the best person I can. I agreed. I snapped out of it as D walked up behind me. He handed me another 2 capsules of mescaline and said he was going to go fuck out in the tent. I took them and decided to go do the same.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "05:00\r\n",
       "I awoke out of a haze of unconscious consciousness. I have no idea how long I lay there in tent for. I cant even describe the things I had done in my mind. I looked at my watch and freaked out, I had been lying there for the whole night. I think my bodies tiredness was too much to handle. I was still very clearly fucked on the mescaline and went to watch the sunrise. I yanked D out of his sleeping bag, and we went up to the rock. He was not talkative, and neither was I but we seemed to communicate without words. We sat in awe of the sunrise. He pulled out the rest of the K and I refused any more. He had a bump and we both just sat in silence for what seemed like ages, I could see ants working, bugs doing there thing, and suddenly felt guilty about work.  Which was the next day. I put it out my mind and continued to watch things going about their comical business. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "For the rest of the morning we didnt do much apart from smoke a few joints and eat some food. D was convinced some of his soul had been stolen. I on the other hand felt like my soul had been given a second chance, another chance to be great. I told him he was being silly and that it was probably the K. He agreed, and started laughing. I said we should do it again next week jokingly, I think he almost fell off his chair, until I said it was a joke. He seemed very serious, and I was starting to feel uncomfortable. I said I was going to bathe in the stream. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "When I returned everyone was packing up, I helped and we left shortly afterwards. I was still very high in the car on the way home and watched as the scenery flitted by. I was relieved to get home, and have a shower. I felt like the shower cleansed me inside. I thought back to what the mescaline had told me and smiled. I knew I would be ok. I watched tv for the rest of the day until I fell fast asleep.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusion:\r\n",
       "I feel I seriously over did it, but things like this dont happen very often. I will be taking a years break from psychedelics, and hope to only do Mescaline and LSD when I start again. I came to the realization, that although psychedelics can reveal truths about myself and the world, it is still a drug, and will be used in the pursuit of a high. I vow never to look at psychedelics in this way again, and treat them with the respect they deserve.\n",

       "It started off as a harmless birthday party. My friends, Nic and Cat, were extremely lucky to get the flat they did. It&amp;#39;s a basement flat and an old deaf lady lives above them so she doesn&amp;#39;t hear the noise. Even the noise of approximately 40 people partying hard with the decks at full volume.\r\n",

       "I arrived at whatever time I arrived. I&amp;#39;m guessing that this was about half seven pm on the Saturday. I was one of the first to arrive, and indeed arrived before the hard-core drugs did, and before the music. So, smoking hash commences. So far it&amp;#39;s not that jumpin a party, but then our guy arrives with some speed, pills, and for some reason a bottle of acid. I&amp;#39;m not sure why he thought the liquid acid would be any good at a party with forty people. Maybe he just happened to have it on him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway, I bought a gram of speed and three pills. I took two pills and had a few lines of base while I was waiting to come up. The speed was great, and the pills were fine. I&amp;#39;m used to doing speed and pills; I do them on a semi-regularly basis just for a bit of fun. Everyone was having a fantastic time, the people who were wasted and the people who were straight (most of them were working the next day). There were people fire dancing, which just looks so amazing when you&amp;#39;re on pretty much any drug, and still looks cool when you&amp;#39;re not.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I persuaded one of my friends to let me have a go of his pois (that&amp;#39;s fire on chains). It&amp;#39;s one of the most fun things to do while off your face. I&amp;#39;d recommend it to anyone, although you should definitely have several people watching you so that if you set your clothes on fire, someone notices for you, because you won&amp;#39;t on you own! We have great photos of one of my friends totally covered in black slimy soot from the paraffin, but I digress.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The bathroom was one of the quiet rooms of the house. It&amp;#39;s a really big bathroom with lots of floor space, and lots of fucked people, for some reason, just began to congregate there. I believe it may have started off just being the bath. I have vagueish memories of sitting in the bath with other people. We talked, we occasionally danced, we smoked hash, and we were all having a great time. There were a few people (there always are at big parties) who were a lot more fucked than everyone else. One girl was wandering about in a daze for most of the night, speeding off her face. There was a guy there who ended up spending almost the entire night unconscious on the sofa. His head bounced spasmodically from side to side. I&amp;#39;m sure in his head he was having a fantastic time dancing away and chatting to people, but he was in fact totally monged out all night. He only opened his eyes when the music stopped (which was rarely) and just sat there looking confused for a few moments before it started up again. Everyone kept half an eye on both these people all night, and both were fine by morning.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "As the night progressed, those who were drug free left for bed. The remainder then separated into two groups. In one group were those for whom it had been enough. They&amp;#39;d either run out of drugs or were too knackered for the drugs to be working any longer. The first group was the one that I was in. We were the hardcore party animals who had been up for the whole night and decided that it would be a good idea to go and watch the sun rise. Eventually this was agreed on and we set off for the beach. It was cold and drizzling slightly. This was not a great environment for people who have been up all night on drugs. I think some of us were feeling that much more of this would simply lead to the dreaded comedown. We climbed the fence into the ruined castle, but we couldn&amp;#39;t find a part of the castle that was sheltered enough to skin up in, so we just headed back. The sky was much lighter, but the sun was still not yet up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat for a while in the living room, our remnant looking more and more depressed as the minutes passed. People skinned up and joints were created, but this was no longer enough for any of us. Then someone suggested that we all go on an acid trip. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. I&amp;#39;d done acid before, but only in very small amounts--enough for a mild trip, but no more--so I was eager to try it properly. Seven of us ended up taking a taxi to the house seven miles out of town where we could trip for six hours or so uninterrupted.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After sitting down and smoking a spliff or two, we got down to business. The guy with the acid reckoned that two drops of the liquid acid would suffice, judging on previous experience from the same bottle. There was one other person there who had never taken a big dose of acid. We agreed to keep an eye on each other. We were all experienced drug users, and expected just to have a laugh and ignore the hideous comedowns that had set in until we could sleep them off a bit later in the day. I don&amp;#39;t actually remember what it tasted like now, but I remember discussing it at the time.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "So that was it; the deed was done. All we could do now was wait. I remember wondering how long it would take. We decided that the curtains should be closed. The view outside wasn&amp;#39;t very stunning, and the cold and the wet looked unpleasant, although the sky was starting to clear by then. I think it was about ten am on the Sunday, but I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat and smoked up some more, waiting, listening to music. I have no idea how long after that we actually started tripping, but I do remember sitting on the sofa looking at the ceiling, fascinated for a while before I realised that it had started. The ceiling was made of pine and was full of knotholes. I&amp;#39;m not sure what drew my eye up there, but I noticed that some of the dark knots had started to move around the ceiling. I pointed this out to everyone, and soon we were all there.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It&amp;#39;s amazing how quickly time passed and how far things degenerated. We spent a long time sitting and chattering amongst ourselves. My brain turned to putty and I kept saying things that I didn&amp;#39;t mean to say. It wasn&amp;#39;t that I didn&amp;#39;t want to say them, it&amp;#39;s just that my train of thought started coming out my mouth. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop stating really obvious things like &amp;#39;The sky is blue&amp;#39; and asking really mundane questions. It made people laugh and it was interesting to see what the LSD had done to my brain.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Going to the toilet turned out to be a bit of an adventure. That sounds slightly wrong, but it really was. I&amp;#39;d been in the same room the whole time and hadn&amp;#39;t even tried walking or standing. When I did get up to go after a few hours of sitting on the floor, it was like trying to walk on the moon. My depth perception was fucked, and I could watch my legs bending and stretching out and shrinking and folding. It was great! As I hadn&amp;#39;t left the room before, I didn&amp;#39;t know what the rest of the house was like. I was very confused. There were stairs everywhere. Some of the staircases were really narrow and long. Others were wide, but only had three or four steps. I was very confused at the time. I couldn&amp;#39;t decide whether or not I was hallucinating all these stairs. There seemed to be a set between every single room. I later on confirmed that this was the case. The house we were in had been built upon an old ruin and started off very small with bits and pieces being added over the years. It was a fantastic house for a trip. In the toilet on the window ledge there were some ornamental shells. There appeared to be lots and lots of spider web just on that shelf and nowhere else. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was real or not, but the spiders kept me from investigating further.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Back in the main room, the knots in the ceiling had turned into beetles and were running all around, but this was ok as the ceiling was where they &amp;#39;belonged&amp;#39; and I intuitively knew that they would stay up there. I had a brief look outside the curtains, but the alien landscape outside was a bit daunting, so I decided to leave it alone. The joint-making had suddenly become very bad indeed. Everything looked wrong. All the dimensions were warped. I tried rolling some cigarettes, and that was difficult enough. It took an enormous amount of concentration. The result of five minutes&amp;#39; work looked extremely strange. Anything we rolled always seemed too short, but the length of the skins hadn&amp;#39;t changed. It was a bit of a mystery. Smoking itself was great fun though. Occasionally it was hard to work out if we&amp;#39;d ashed the carpet by mistake or if something had fallen off the end of the spliff or roll-up, but usually after checking the carpet nothing had. Watching the smoke curl and float about was fantastic. At times it looked solid and so real, but then my perception would shift again slightly and I&amp;#39;d see infinitely deeply into the smoke and out the other side. It&amp;#39;s a difficult thing to describe, but it was mesmerising.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After maybe four or five hours of this, one of us received a phone call to say that their flat was being inspected. The poor guy who had been phoned had absolutely no idea what to do. We were all far too fucked to be of any help cleaning up the flat. That was our first stress. I remember looking at the clock at that point to check how long it was until the flat inspection was supposed to occur. This was almost impossible. At one point the three different hands on the clock ticked in three different directions, even though there are only two directions (clockwise and anticlockwise) possible and only one direction they were made to go in. I realised at that point that my brain was fucked enough to be creating three dimensions out of two-dimensional object. I decided that now would be my best chance ever of imagining a hyper-cube (a four-dimesional cube for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know), or better yet--as three dimensional representations of four-dimensional cubes are almost possible, making them easier to picture--a hyper-sphere would be really really impressive. I spent about five minutes doing this. My brain boggled and came close to leaking out my ears. I decided it would be better just to leave it for another time. I kept being destracted by the stress of my fellow trippers.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Our second stress, and first major problem occurred at about four o&amp;#39;clock. The guy to whom the house we were in belonged received a text message from his parents to say that they were coming home early (they hadn&amp;#39;t been due back for a day) and would see him in about an hour. At this point things became really confusing for me. We managed to work out that we&amp;#39;d all have to leave. We also had to tidy up and leave no evidence of our being there. The problem was that we couldn&amp;#39;t agree on where to go. I reckoned the best place would be to go back to the party flat that we&amp;#39;d started in. It would be safe there, and people would understand our predicament and leave us to come back down to baseline. Others believed that heading for the fields to look for magic mushrooms would be a much better idea. We eventually got the place tidied up, but it took a long time and a lot of effort. People started making toast and soup, thinking that this would help in some way. The windows were opened to let the room air, but this was confusing as the wind began blowing things around. I remember some of the observations I made at the time. One that sticks out was that we had been reduced to mob mentality. A person can be intelligent, but people are stupid. We were like people, I realised. Not just seven people. We were more like 700 all trying to do the same task. We got in each other&amp;#39;s way, we drifted about aimlessly, and we did things that didn&amp;#39;t need to be done. Eventually we got organised enough to think properly about leaving and where to go. I remember being really proud of our achievement at this time. I decided that we were like different facets of the same mind. We had had a goal, and we had achieved it. We&amp;#39;d done what we set out to do, and somehow the idea of a hive-mind seemed agreeable to me at the time. We were just deciding that it would be a good idea to get in a taxi back to town when a taxi pulled up outside. After a moment&amp;#39;s conference we discovered that someone had already phoned one and forgotten about it completely.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Just a quick note here: at the time I didn&amp;#39;t know that we were tripping more heavily and for longer than we&amp;#39;d intended. It was my first time taking this much acid, so I thought that this was all going to plan, except of course the early return of parents. I was very happy up until the point that we left the house. There were stresses and problems, but they weren&amp;#39;t my worries. I could try and help, and just tried not to think about the fact that we had to leave the house. It made me feel a bit panicky, thinking about how we were going to get the seven miles back into town in a direction I didn&amp;#39;t know and go somewhere we hadnt&amp;#39; decided, so I just didn&amp;#39;t think about it until I had to.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It took us so long to get out to the taxi that he&amp;#39;d started to drive off, but one guy ran after it and stopped him. I have no idea what he said to convince the driver to let seven heavily-tripping people into his taxi, but it worked. I was sat in the back and the guy I was sitting next to started talking to me about stabbing a biro pen into the neck of the taxi driver to stop him telling anyone. I thought/hoped he was joking and went along with him for a bit. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell how loud we were talking though and started to worry that the driver could hear us. We got back into town and the driver asked us where in town we wanted to go. Seven different voices stated seven different destinations. The taxi driver said that he&amp;#39;d just drop us off where we were so I shouted over them all and told the driver to take us to the street the party had been on. This was where the party had started, and it seemed fitting to me that it should also end there.\r\n",

       "We were all just heading down to the original party flat, when some of us decided that the pub would be better and our local was the safest. Apparently people were thinking that if we went back to the flat we&amp;#39;d get roped into cleaning up, which, in our hallucinatory state, would not have been easy. I remember asking everyone individually if they&amp;#39;d rather go to the pub or back to a nice flat where we could chill, and only one person actually wanted to go to the pub. However, the group mind had already decided and there seemed to be no way out of it. We walked into the pub at about half past five on the Sunday evening. Thankfully it was quiet. There were only about six people there, and I knew most of them at least vaguely. Perhaps this wouldn&amp;#39;t be too bad after all. Some of us sat down, and some of us ordered drinks. I sat down and waited to see what would happen next. The general opinion seemed to be that we were going to have a drink here and then move on to the flat, but, of course, it really didn&amp;#39;t work that way.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in the pub for almost three hours. Those were the worst three hours of my life. I think that I started really coming down off the speed from the night before about then. I started getting intensely paranoid. I remember trying to interact with some of the people there, but the attempt was futile. I&amp;#39;d hear them say half of a sentence that made no sense before they descended into what seemed to me to be complete gibberish, not even speaking words.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "During those hours, I sat mulling over what course of action I should take; many thoughts crossed my mind. I considered killing everyone, or myself, or screaming at everyone to stop fucking with my mind. Words can&amp;#39;t express that experience. I know now what a bad trip is be like, but I would still do it again. I was actally in hell for what felt like days. However, I pride myself on the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t completely freak out. On the inside, I completely fell apart, but outwardly I was fine. I was told that my eyes were as big as saucers the whole time I was there, and my sober friends could tell that all was not well, but I didn&amp;#39;t completely break down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My thoughts were running in circles. Random thoughts were going through my head that I had no real control over. I felt my mind fracture and splinter, and it was such an effort just to keep myself in the seat, but on the other hand, I felt that I couldn&amp;#39;t leave everyone else because I would then be truly alone and I was scared. I was terrified that I wouldn&amp;#39;t recover and that I&amp;#39;d spend the rest of my life in this living hell. I felt so small and fragile. I honestly contemplated suicide and murder, and for a while I actually did think that I was already dead and that this was hell.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I don&amp;#39;t know how bad that was, but I do know that things could have gone a lot worse. If I had lost my self control, I honestly would completely have freaked out. I had a long time to think about many things. I don&amp;#39;t know whether or not the conclusions that I made during that time are correct or not, but I do know that I learned a lot about myself and the way my mind works. I survived.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I could tell myself that this was something beyond my control, that the tripping would stop at somepoint, and that everything would be normal again. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it would have been better if I&amp;#39;d left the pub or not. I do know that I couldn&amp;#39;t though. I had to stay with the other tripping people. I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to face the world on my own. I became extremely insecure.\r\n",
       "\n",

       "At several points, I could feel my mind fracture and spin off in different directions. It was a bit like the clock from before. The clock whose hands went in three different directions. I had more than one train of thought running at once. It&amp;#39;s an extremely bizarre feeling. I couldn&amp;#39;t focus on anything for more than a few seconds...literally. I don&amp;#39;t know how many times I asked when we were going to head back to the flat, but I think it was quite a lot.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I remember feeling me trying to hide within myself, that is, my self awareness or my consciousness was retreating deeper and deeper. I think that this was some kind of defense mechanism. I was trying to get away from what I was experiencing, but I couldn&amp;#39;t physically get out, only hide myself mentally. At the time, I thought that this might be how some patients at mental hospitals must live. It frightened me to realise just how much acid can fuck a person up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I&amp;#39;m giving up on trying to describe this properly. I can&amp;#39;t even remember it clearly and I really can&amp;#39;t find the words to convey what it was like. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to some of the people that were in the pub at the time. I wanted to find out how much they had been trying to fuck with us, and it turned out not to be that much at all. I could have sworn that half of the time I was there, people were trying to mess with our minds. That, however, was just my mind messing with me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Having experienced this though, I&amp;#39;d still say that acid is a really fun drug to use, but in future I&amp;#39;m going to treat it with a bit more respect and caution. I know that I have a tendency to rush into things without really thinking the consequences through properly, but at the same time I have an excellent capacity to look after myself.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I spent over a week dazed and confused from that experience. I later learned that our dosage had been misjudged. The fact that we&amp;#39;d been up all night partying hard and taking other drugs was not taken into account and what was supposed to be a mild six-hour trip became a twelve hour epic adventure. This is an experience that I will never ever forget, and something that I hope I can really learn from. I know that I have already gained a lot of knowledge about myself. I know it&amp;#39;s a bit of an acid cliche, but it&amp;#39;s one of those cliches that you really don&amp;#39;t appreciate until you&amp;#39;ve been through it yourself. It takes a lot of strength to face yourself on a hellish introspective acid trip-gone-wrong. It&amp;#39;s definitely not something that I wanted to experience, but I&amp;#39;ve done it and in a way I&amp;#39;m glad that I have.\r\n",

       "For anyone that&amp;#39;s taken the time to read this, sorry for the meandering aspect of this account. I have a tendency to ramble a bit. On the whole I reckon it really was a positive experience and it&amp;#39;s definitely not put me off trying acid again in the future. I&amp;#39;m not really sure what that says about me as a person, but once again I don&amp;#39;t really care. I&amp;#39;m happy being who I am.&quot;&gt;\n",

       "I arrived at whatever time I arrived. I&amp;#39;m guessing that this was about half seven pm on the Saturday. I was one of the first to arrive, and indeed arrived before the hard-core drugs did, and before the music. So, smoking hash commences. So far it&amp;#39;s not that jumpin a party, but then our guy arrives with some speed, pills, and for some reason a bottle of acid. I&amp;#39;m not sure why he thought the liquid acid would be any good at a party with forty people. Maybe he just happened to have it on him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway, I bought a gram of speed and three pills. I took two pills and had a few lines of base while I was waiting to come up. The speed was great, and the pills were fine. I&amp;#39;m used to doing speed and pills; I do them on a semi-regularly basis just for a bit of fun. Everyone was having a fantastic time, the people who were wasted and the people who were straight (most of them were working the next day). There were people fire dancing, which just looks so amazing when you&amp;#39;re on pretty much any drug, and still looks cool when you&amp;#39;re not.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I persuaded one of my friends to let me have a go of his pois (that&amp;#39;s fire on chains). It&amp;#39;s one of the most fun things to do while off your face. I&amp;#39;d recommend it to anyone, although you should definitely have several people watching you so that if you set your clothes on fire, someone notices for you, because you won&amp;#39;t on you own! We have great photos of one of my friends totally covered in black slimy soot from the paraffin, but I digress.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The bathroom was one of the quiet rooms of the house. It&amp;#39;s a really big bathroom with lots of floor space, and lots of fucked people, for some reason, just began to congregate there. I believe it may have started off just being the bath. I have vagueish memories of sitting in the bath with other people. We talked, we occasionally danced, we smoked hash, and we were all having a great time. There were a few people (there always are at big parties) who were a lot more fucked than everyone else. One girl was wandering about in a daze for most of the night, speeding off her face. There was a guy there who ended up spending almost the entire night unconscious on the sofa. His head bounced spasmodically from side to side. I&amp;#39;m sure in his head he was having a fantastic time dancing away and chatting to people, but he was in fact totally monged out all night. He only opened his eyes when the music stopped (which was rarely) and just sat there looking confused for a few moments before it started up again. Everyone kept half an eye on both these people all night, and both were fine by morning.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "As the night progressed, those who were drug free left for bed. The remainder then separated into two groups. In one group were those for whom it had been enough. They&amp;#39;d either run out of drugs or were too knackered for the drugs to be working any longer. The first group was the one that I was in. We were the hardcore party animals who had been up for the whole night and decided that it would be a good idea to go and watch the sun rise. Eventually this was agreed on and we set off for the beach. It was cold and drizzling slightly. This was not a great environment for people who have been up all night on drugs. I think some of us were feeling that much more of this would simply lead to the dreaded comedown. We climbed the fence into the ruined castle, but we couldn&amp;#39;t find a part of the castle that was sheltered enough to skin up in, so we just headed back. The sky was much lighter, but the sun was still not yet up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat for a while in the living room, our remnant looking more and more depressed as the minutes passed. People skinned up and joints were created, but this was no longer enough for any of us. Then someone suggested that we all go on an acid trip. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. I&amp;#39;d done acid before, but only in very small amounts--enough for a mild trip, but no more--so I was eager to try it properly. Seven of us ended up taking a taxi to the house seven miles out of town where we could trip for six hours or so uninterrupted.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After sitting down and smoking a spliff or two, we got down to business. The guy with the acid reckoned that two drops of the liquid acid would suffice, judging on previous experience from the same bottle. There was one other person there who had never taken a big dose of acid. We agreed to keep an eye on each other. We were all experienced drug users, and expected just to have a laugh and ignore the hideous comedowns that had set in until we could sleep them off a bit later in the day. I don&amp;#39;t actually remember what it tasted like now, but I remember discussing it at the time.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "So that was it; the deed was done. All we could do now was wait. I remember wondering how long it would take. We decided that the curtains should be closed. The view outside wasn&amp;#39;t very stunning, and the cold and the wet looked unpleasant, although the sky was starting to clear by then. I think it was about ten am on the Sunday, but I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We sat and smoked up some more, waiting, listening to music. I have no idea how long after that we actually started tripping, but I do remember sitting on the sofa looking at the ceiling, fascinated for a while before I realised that it had started. The ceiling was made of pine and was full of knotholes. I&amp;#39;m not sure what drew my eye up there, but I noticed that some of the dark knots had started to move around the ceiling. I pointed this out to everyone, and soon we were all there.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It&amp;#39;s amazing how quickly time passed and how far things degenerated. We spent a long time sitting and chattering amongst ourselves. My brain turned to putty and I kept saying things that I didn&amp;#39;t mean to say. It wasn&amp;#39;t that I didn&amp;#39;t want to say them, it&amp;#39;s just that my train of thought started coming out my mouth. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop stating really obvious things like &amp;#39;The sky is blue&amp;#39; and asking really mundane questions. It made people laugh and it was interesting to see what the LSD had done to my brain.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Going to the toilet turned out to be a bit of an adventure. That sounds slightly wrong, but it really was. I&amp;#39;d been in the same room the whole time and hadn&amp;#39;t even tried walking or standing. When I did get up to go after a few hours of sitting on the floor, it was like trying to walk on the moon. My depth perception was fucked, and I could watch my legs bending and stretching out and shrinking and folding. It was great! As I hadn&amp;#39;t left the room before, I didn&amp;#39;t know what the rest of the house was like. I was very confused. There were stairs everywhere. Some of the staircases were really narrow and long. Others were wide, but only had three or four steps. I was very confused at the time. I couldn&amp;#39;t decide whether or not I was hallucinating all these stairs. There seemed to be a set between every single room. I later on confirmed that this was the case. The house we were in had been built upon an old ruin and started off very small with bits and pieces being added over the years. It was a fantastic house for a trip. In the toilet on the window ledge there were some ornamental shells. There appeared to be lots and lots of spider web just on that shelf and nowhere else. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if it was real or not, but the spiders kept me from investigating further.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Back in the main room, the knots in the ceiling had turned into beetles and were running all around, but this was ok as the ceiling was where they &amp;#39;belonged&amp;#39; and I intuitively knew that they would stay up there. I had a brief look outside the curtains, but the alien landscape outside was a bit daunting, so I decided to leave it alone. The joint-making had suddenly become very bad indeed. Everything looked wrong. All the dimensions were warped. I tried rolling some cigarettes, and that was difficult enough. It took an enormous amount of concentration. The result of five minutes&amp;#39; work looked extremely strange. Anything we rolled always seemed too short, but the length of the skins hadn&amp;#39;t changed. It was a bit of a mystery. Smoking itself was great fun though. Occasionally it was hard to work out if we&amp;#39;d ashed the carpet by mistake or if something had fallen off the end of the spliff or roll-up, but usually after checking the carpet nothing had. Watching the smoke curl and float about was fantastic. At times it looked solid and so real, but then my perception would shift again slightly and I&amp;#39;d see infinitely deeply into the smoke and out the other side. It&amp;#39;s a difficult thing to describe, but it was mesmerising.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After maybe four or five hours of this, one of us received a phone call to say that their flat was being inspected. The poor guy who had been phoned had absolutely no idea what to do. We were all far too fucked to be of any help cleaning up the flat. That was our first stress. I remember looking at the clock at that point to check how long it was until the flat inspection was supposed to occur. This was almost impossible. At one point the three different hands on the clock ticked in three different directions, even though there are only two directions (clockwise and anticlockwise) possible and only one direction they were made to go in. I realised at that point that my brain was fucked enough to be creating three dimensions out of two-dimensional object. I decided that now would be my best chance ever of imagining a hyper-cube (a four-dimesional cube for those of you who don&amp;#39;t know), or better yet--as three dimensional representations of four-dimensional cubes are almost possible, making them easier to picture--a hyper-sphere would be really really impressive. I spent about five minutes doing this. My brain boggled and came close to leaking out my ears. I decided it would be better just to leave it for another time. I kept being destracted by the stress of my fellow trippers.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Our second stress, and first major problem occurred at about four o&amp;#39;clock. The guy to whom the house we were in belonged received a text message from his parents to say that they were coming home early (they hadn&amp;#39;t been due back for a day) and would see him in about an hour. At this point things became really confusing for me. We managed to work out that we&amp;#39;d all have to leave. We also had to tidy up and leave no evidence of our being there. The problem was that we couldn&amp;#39;t agree on where to go. I reckoned the best place would be to go back to the party flat that we&amp;#39;d started in. It would be safe there, and people would understand our predicament and leave us to come back down to baseline. Others believed that heading for the fields to look for magic mushrooms would be a much better idea. We eventually got the place tidied up, but it took a long time and a lot of effort. People started making toast and soup, thinking that this would help in some way. The windows were opened to let the room air, but this was confusing as the wind began blowing things around. I remember some of the observations I made at the time. One that sticks out was that we had been reduced to mob mentality. A person can be intelligent, but people are stupid. We were like people, I realised. Not just seven people. We were more like 700 all trying to do the same task. We got in each other&amp;#39;s way, we drifted about aimlessly, and we did things that didn&amp;#39;t need to be done. Eventually we got organised enough to think properly about leaving and where to go. I remember being really proud of our achievement at this time. I decided that we were like different facets of the same mind. We had had a goal, and we had achieved it. We&amp;#39;d done what we set out to do, and somehow the idea of a hive-mind seemed agreeable to me at the time. We were just deciding that it would be a good idea to get in a taxi back to town when a taxi pulled up outside. After a moment&amp;#39;s conference we discovered that someone had already phoned one and forgotten about it completely.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Just a quick note here: at the time I didn&amp;#39;t know that we were tripping more heavily and for longer than we&amp;#39;d intended. It was my first time taking this much acid, so I thought that this was all going to plan, except of course the early return of parents. I was very happy up until the point that we left the house. There were stresses and problems, but they weren&amp;#39;t my worries. I could try and help, and just tried not to think about the fact that we had to leave the house. It made me feel a bit panicky, thinking about how we were going to get the seven miles back into town in a direction I didn&amp;#39;t know and go somewhere we hadnt&amp;#39; decided, so I just didn&amp;#39;t think about it until I had to.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It took us so long to get out to the taxi that he&amp;#39;d started to drive off, but one guy ran after it and stopped him. I have no idea what he said to convince the driver to let seven heavily-tripping people into his taxi, but it worked. I was sat in the back and the guy I was sitting next to started talking to me about stabbing a biro pen into the neck of the taxi driver to stop him telling anyone. I thought/hoped he was joking and went along with him for a bit. I couldn&amp;#39;t tell how loud we were talking though and started to worry that the driver could hear us. We got back into town and the driver asked us where in town we wanted to go. Seven different voices stated seven different destinations. The taxi driver said that he&amp;#39;d just drop us off where we were so I shouted over them all and told the driver to take us to the street the party had been on. This was where the party had started, and it seemed fitting to me that it should also end there.\r\n",

       "We were all just heading down to the original party flat, when some of us decided that the pub would be better and our local was the safest. Apparently people were thinking that if we went back to the flat we&amp;#39;d get roped into cleaning up, which, in our hallucinatory state, would not have been easy. I remember asking everyone individually if they&amp;#39;d rather go to the pub or back to a nice flat where we could chill, and only one person actually wanted to go to the pub. However, the group mind had already decided and there seemed to be no way out of it. We walked into the pub at about half past five on the Sunday evening. Thankfully it was quiet. There were only about six people there, and I knew most of them at least vaguely. Perhaps this wouldn&amp;#39;t be too bad after all. Some of us sat down, and some of us ordered drinks. I sat down and waited to see what would happen next. The general opinion seemed to be that we were going to have a drink here and then move on to the flat, but, of course, it really didn&amp;#39;t work that way.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in the pub for almost three hours. Those were the worst three hours of my life. I think that I started really coming down off the speed from the night before about then. I started getting intensely paranoid. I remember trying to interact with some of the people there, but the attempt was futile. I&amp;#39;d hear them say half of a sentence that made no sense before they descended into what seemed to me to be complete gibberish, not even speaking words.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "During those hours, I sat mulling over what course of action I should take; many thoughts crossed my mind. I considered killing everyone, or myself, or screaming at everyone to stop fucking with my mind. Words can&amp;#39;t express that experience. I know now what a bad trip is be like, but I would still do it again. I was actally in hell for what felt like days. However, I pride myself on the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t completely freak out. On the inside, I completely fell apart, but outwardly I was fine. I was told that my eyes were as big as saucers the whole time I was there, and my sober friends could tell that all was not well, but I didn&amp;#39;t completely break down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My thoughts were running in circles. Random thoughts were going through my head that I had no real control over. I felt my mind fracture and splinter, and it was such an effort just to keep myself in the seat, but on the other hand, I felt that I couldn&amp;#39;t leave everyone else because I would then be truly alone and I was scared. I was terrified that I wouldn&amp;#39;t recover and that I&amp;#39;d spend the rest of my life in this living hell. I felt so small and fragile. I honestly contemplated suicide and murder, and for a while I actually did think that I was already dead and that this was hell.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I don&amp;#39;t know how bad that was, but I do know that things could have gone a lot worse. If I had lost my self control, I honestly would completely have freaked out. I had a long time to think about many things. I don&amp;#39;t know whether or not the conclusions that I made during that time are correct or not, but I do know that I learned a lot about myself and the way my mind works. I survived.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I could tell myself that this was something beyond my control, that the tripping would stop at somepoint, and that everything would be normal again. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it would have been better if I&amp;#39;d left the pub or not. I do know that I couldn&amp;#39;t though. I had to stay with the other tripping people. I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to face the world on my own. I became extremely insecure.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I&amp;#39;m going to try and record some of the conclusions that I made while I was in this state. It&amp;#39;s going to be hard to put into words though.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "At several points, I could feel my mind fracture and spin off in different directions. It was a bit like the clock from before. The clock whose hands went in three different directions. I had more than one train of thought running at once. It&amp;#39;s an extremely bizarre feeling. I couldn&amp;#39;t focus on anything for more than a few seconds...literally. I don&amp;#39;t know how many times I asked when we were going to head back to the flat, but I think it was quite a lot.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I remember feeling me trying to hide within myself, that is, my self awareness or my consciousness was retreating deeper and deeper. I think that this was some kind of defense mechanism. I was trying to get away from what I was experiencing, but I couldn&amp;#39;t physically get out, only hide myself mentally. At the time, I thought that this might be how some patients at mental hospitals must live. It frightened me to realise just how much acid can fuck a person up.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I&amp;#39;m giving up on trying to describe this properly. I can&amp;#39;t even remember it clearly and I really can&amp;#39;t find the words to convey what it was like. I&amp;#39;ve spoken to some of the people that were in the pub at the time. I wanted to find out how much they had been trying to fuck with us, and it turned out not to be that much at all. I could have sworn that half of the time I was there, people were trying to mess with our minds. That, however, was just my mind messing with me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Having experienced this though, I&amp;#39;d still say that acid is a really fun drug to use, but in future I&amp;#39;m going to treat it with a bit more respect and caution. I know that I have a tendency to rush into things without really thinking the consequences through properly, but at the same time I have an excellent capacity to look after myself.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I spent over a week dazed and confused from that experience. I later learned that our dosage had been misjudged. The fact that we&amp;#39;d been up all night partying hard and taking other drugs was not taken into account and what was supposed to be a mild six-hour trip became a twelve hour epic adventure. This is an experience that I will never ever forget, and something that I hope I can really learn from. I know that I have already gained a lot of knowledge about myself. I know it&amp;#39;s a bit of an acid cliche, but it&amp;#39;s one of those cliches that you really don&amp;#39;t appreciate until you&amp;#39;ve been through it yourself. It takes a lot of strength to face yourself on a hellish introspective acid trip-gone-wrong. It&amp;#39;s definitely not something that I wanted to experience, but I&amp;#39;ve done it and in a way I&amp;#39;m glad that I have.\r\n",

       "For anyone that&amp;#39;s taken the time to read this, sorry for the meandering aspect of this account. I have a tendency to ramble a bit. On the whole I reckon it really was a positive experience and it&amp;#39;s definitely not put me off trying acid again in the future. I&amp;#39;m not really sure what that says about me as a person, but once again I don&amp;#39;t really care. I&amp;#39;m happy being who I am.\n",

       "I had packed about 2 more bowls and passed it around. I felt a shift in atmosphere but I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what exactly was changing. Eventually we left the people I didn&amp;#39;t really know and it was the campers and I. We moved closer to the music and some went back to camp to look for LSD. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "They all came back saying they took their acid and we just marinated on the grass by the main stage, staring at things, intrigued with how everything looked more beautiful and how everything had been starting to melt. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "It was eventually just a girl and I together somehow and we just lay by each other, discussing everything we see and what&amp;#39;s happening in each others minds. This seemed to be one of the most epic things and I felt really connected to this girl. We laid and stared at trees. Things had seemed to be blooming. Trees would grow outwards and then blossom with flowers on the tips, and then those flowers would slowly blossom towards me!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We eventually went and sat on the the other side of the pond thing where we were pretty much secluded from everybody but could still see everything. We still lay and sit there chatting about the usual.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon later, my friend K, had run up to us with a water gun and two kids about 7 years old who both had water guns. They started chasing us and shooting us with water guns. This was a little irritating considering I was not in the mind set to deal with kids. But it took a quick turn around. It soon felt like I was a kid again, it was exactly like playing tag when I was in elementary school! Being chased around by the 3 people was one of the most coolest experiences to happen at the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P (the girl I felt connected with), C, and I started to book it back to the campsite which had to be about 3 or 4 football fields away. The kids were still chasing us!! And they managed to keep up some how. I was outstanded, thrilled and a little scared too. These kids were on a mission and it was to get us wet!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The kids caught up to us and finally used up all their water after about an hour! It was a terrific accomplishment finally being able to sit and just enjoy.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By now I was just starting to peak and I had been tripping out so hard! I sat by my new friend R, who was giving me advice on how to take an acid trip. While he was explaining I remember just looking up at the trees, and things changed color and texture for a brief about 5 seconds. In this little while I had forgotten who I was.  R is one of the smartest people I know and have met! He has the best advice anybody has ever given me. It&amp;#39;s unbelievable!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had experienced a bad trip before, and I told him I experienced an &amp;#39;ego death&amp;#39; which he later told me was &amp;#39;Ego Freedom&amp;#39;. He was saying stuff like, if you start to have a bad trip just remember, that its like sitting in a canoe going down a river. All you need to do is tell yourself that and you&amp;#39;ll be fine. What ever you see going down that river will eventually be behind you and don&amp;#39;t let one bad idea spiral into a nightmare. He also said that LSD is a big head game with yourself, sure you can be with other friends but when it comes down to it, its just you, within your mind! I was so stoked on how smart R was and how great of a friend I made him this festival!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He eventually went to the stage where I just laid on the blanket outside on our site and just tripped out for awhile. Trees and other nature were still blooming and blossoming before my eyes. As well the world had began to feel like I was a cartoon living in a cartoon world. Nothing looked, or seemed real in the slightest. My reality was shattered. Later heading back to the music where I met up with P again. Night had fallen I believe. It&amp;#39;s hard to remember everything - I was tripping balls. Then I seemed to lose everybody but P, so we were together the entire night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We started to dance and I was loving it. She soon says she doesn&amp;#39;t want to dance so I said we can go for a walk and chill. The both of us walked and went on an adventure on a random path.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I held her hand on the way there. She looks at me and says &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;re you doing?&amp;#39; (Something like that, I&amp;#39;m unsure.) I apologize instantly and realize she doesn&amp;#39;t want anything. While walking she eventually grabs my hand about 10 minutes later. I was surprised and didn&amp;#39;t know what to think.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Ends up we walked around the whole camp site and ended back up at the main desk/pond. We found a really nice spot to lay down and look at the stars and the ravers in the distance. She tells me how it&amp;#39;s weird, she said she&amp;#39;s usually one of the ravers just going to the music.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I still relaxing on the grass. Enjoying the music and the comfort of each other, gazing into the stars. We realize dark clouds are slowly drifting on top of us. I suggest that a storm may be coming possibly.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Everything had become very calm, cool and still. It was the calm before the storm. The storm seemed like a hurricane on the prairies! I&amp;#39;ve never seen so much rain fall in my life. P and I decided to go sit under a tree thinking we could wait out the storm, but it just got worse and worse. The storm was raining through all the trees and we were getting soaked! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We decided to go up the stairs by the main office where it was dry. While on the way up to the stairs we found L, a friend/camper! He had done acid for his first time and was also very drunk, he was hysterical! Upon walking up the stairs, which had literally looked like a water fall now, flowing like niagra falls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "At the top, soaked. L says &amp;#39;so is the party over&amp;#39; I couldn&amp;#39;t hold back but to laugh! He was standing in the rain, in a puddle, under a gutter!! He could not have gotten anymore wet, he was using the gutter as if it were a shower and was dancing in the puddle.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The storm had eventually passed and we went to go check the aftermath of the storm. The main stage had been demolished. I was super bummed! It was such a dope stage! We eventually went back to the spot where we had been sitting. And there was an enormous tree branch that had fallen as well as many other small ones! Just about 2 meters away, that is crazy!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I go to sit on the big stair by the pond and star gaze again. We see a star that looks significantly different from all the rest. Both of us begin talking, suggesting that its a UFO, P starts to cry out of joy and confusion and amazement. I feel incredibly connected to her. We were both in the same mind set, thinking we were seeing one of the wonders of the world. After about an hour or 2 of watching this star. We finally come to the realization that its a planet and it looks so different because its reflecting the sun!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Feeling kind of tired, I tell P and she says she has MDMA we could have. I thought that it was a great idea so we headed back to camp. The stage was working now, but there was no visuals at the time. We grab a bunch of MDMA. 3 of us snort some of it (my first time snorting it). K also snorted some (friend/camper). We had also grabbed some alcohol to drink.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally arriving at the main stage, about an hour or two from sunrise, we begin to dance. I see a lot of familiar faces on the dance floor. Such as R! He had a 7 foot stick with an inflatable heart at the top of it. This looked so fucking epic and awesome! I loved it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had entered a trance where there was no way I could stop dancing! Soon doing more MDMA. My memory is a little foggy after this. But I remember I danced till sunrise. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "4 others and I headed back to camp to grab a blanket and go to the pond to watch the sun rise. Quickly coming to the realization that we are all tired and want to sleep. We went back to home (camp) and slept.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 3\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Not too much happened during the day. I talked with everybody about last evening. There was now an awkwardness between P and I for some unknown reason which remained the rest of the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Also I took R&amp;#39;s heart he had on his stick and held it to me, later suggesting that it would be cool to tape it to my chest! Which we instantly did, I felt like I belonged there now. The heart symbolizing connection between everyone which is how I felt the festival was!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That day I talked about shrooms to everyone and was unsure if I should try them as I had not done the before. I asked R for advice and he said I should try them. So I went and got 1 gram of Chocolate covered mushrooms.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By this point I was shit-faced! Shortly after, I ate the mush. It put the entire thing in my mouth. It was way too much to handle in one bite, but I managed to chew it down anyway. It was a thick dry milk chocolate and you could taste the mushrooms very slightly, it was although it was eating chocolate with nuts in it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We headed to the dance floor. I was feeling a slight shift in my reality. Once again, I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what it was! We walked as a big group down. I was walking beside R. I was chatting with him saying how he&amp;#39;s so smart and gives the best advice! I asked if I could call him my shaman, as that is how I felt about him, anything I wondered or needed to know, he knew! Even when I didn&amp;#39;t ask. He replied with yes and I was super stoked!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "On arrival I drink a bit of my alcohol that I brought with me to the dance. I was definitely still wasted and now tripping a little bit from shrooms. After losing almost everybody except C I was bummed out and decided to sit by the pond. I felt like passing out; I was not having a good time. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I pretty much sat around for an hour or two alone until the alchohol wore off so I actually felt amazing after! Colors simply looked out of this world. It was like I had been color blind and I was seeing colors for the first time ever, colors were simply beautiful! I also has a huge body stone, which felt a bit like MDMA but my body felt more numb. I was still once again looking for others! I could not find ANYBODY! I did not know what to do and I was panicking a bit. But soon came to the realization that I can always meet new friends and just enjoy life! They had also redone the stage and it was as good as new! The stage once again looked phenomenal!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "This concept was a bit difficult for me usually as I am a shy person, but when I was on mushrooms, drunk, and high from weed. It came as though it was a natural gift I soon possessed. I went to the very front of the speakers and started to dance. I had practiced shuffling before, but once again! It just came naturally now.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was having the best time of my life! I had become the music. I felt as though everybody was my family and that we were all at harmony! I danced for a couple hours till I finally found some people I knew from camp.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had not had water the whole time and I was soaking wet with sweat! I saw R and one of the first words that came out of my mouth was, water! He reacted as fast as he could to get my water. I was amazed at this simple but yet amazing gesture! I soon told him what was happening and he said we should go sit down and relax as I had been over heating. We had very intellectual conversations. He was telling me how he used to have a drug problem and how he is as a person.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He said he&amp;#39;s terrific at helping others out with their problems but when it comes to his own, sometimes he struggles deeply. I was shocked as he was one of the smartest and nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met. He told me that J had been his shaman, like he was to me (a girl who we were camping with). He was trying to say I understand what you&amp;#39;re going through and I&amp;#39;m there for you bro. R eventually says that kids usually fuck up with drugs, but I can handle it really well and that he wants to go into big brothers big sisters. I felt incredible for him and I encouraged him to do it! Even I wish I could have him for a big bro. He wants to show kids that fuck up with drugs that you don&amp;#39;t need to take 9 pills to have a good time or 12 grams of shrooms. It just takes a little. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "After out heart to heart talk, he had the brilliant idea that we should put the inflatable heart on my back and not my chest because it gets in the way of dancing , especially dancing with girls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon after doing so I started dancing again. I asked him for tips on trying to find a girl there as I couldn&amp;#39;t find one I was attracted to! Once again, it came as no surprise, he gave the greatest advice ever!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "R told me to just go find a spot where I was comfortable, close my eyes and just let the music do its part, just lose myself within the music. And when I open my eyes, I&amp;#39;d lock eyes with a girl and everything would be great. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Oddly enough, I did exactly as he said, and guess what!? I locked eyes with a girl and we soon began dancing with each other! She was one of the cutest girls at the whole thing, a little raver girl wearing a mini skirt, furry boots, bikini top, and a cat hat that looked really sexy! I was shocked at how good of advice R gives, like, it&amp;#39;s insane! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was feeling euphoric for probably one of the first times ever. It felt like absolutely everybody was my best friend and that there was no ice to break. This was a little odd to me because I&amp;#39;m a shy timid person around new people, especially adults. It was the greatest feeling I&amp;#39;ve ever felt! I cannot even explain how terrific this felt. Just feeling the love of everybody, at complete unity and peace with one another as human beings! I&amp;#39;d smile at somebody, they&amp;#39;d smile back. I was shuffling and almost instantly I found other shufflers around me, shuffling with me! It was incredible and unreal. I almost could not believe this was happening. I was shuffling in sync with others and we would take turns, I truly discovered what it was like to lose your ego at this point. I didn&amp;#39;t care what anybody looked like but only the connection we shared. It legitimately felt like everybody was at one huge family at a reunion!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After dancing the night away, most of the crowd had disappeared into the fog of the night. I told J (the girl I had been dancing with) that I was tired. She instantly concurred with me and I asked if we should head back. We started to head back and I asked what she did tonight. She had done acid and smoked weed which was cool and would have been a blast as well.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got to my tent where we went in to the tent and there was no way we were going to sleep. After dancing with her all night, I felt connect and incredibly attracted to her, there was no holding back. I soon found us having sex! The sex was incredible. It&amp;#39;s inevitable to explain how great everything was. I didn&amp;#39;t have a single worry in the world and I could not be happier!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 4 (final day of music)\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Later that morning I saw J leave but I was still asleep. I woke up later that morning thinking to myself I&amp;#39;d never see her again and I was kind of bummed as she was from the same city I was and I thought we could have been friends.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had bought more shrooms for the night today and I still had an entire vial of MDMA. Not too much happened during the day so I&amp;#39;m going to skip to night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That night I took the mushrooms and took about an eighth of the MDMA which isn&amp;#39;t a lot but it seemed to do wonders! I&amp;#39;d like to start off by saying I have never been higher in my life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I took the mushrooms and right after parachuted the MDMA. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to expect as this was the first time I had ever &amp;#39;hippie flipped&amp;#39;. I started to feel a shift in reality as usual. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had arrived to the dance floor and everything began to look amazing. The lights looked mesmerizing. The bass from the music became my heartbeat. My body was feeling numb but at peace. I had the giggles like I want a young baby and I felt butterfly like feelings inside my stomach which in turn made me smile and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop! Things started to look like they were from a 3D pop out book. I remember I walked by this tree a ton and it just looked more and more different every time. It just seemed to POP out at me! This had been the greatest I have felt in my entire life! I don&amp;#39;t remember a point in the night where I was not smiling. I was the happiest person in the world!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Dancing for an hour or so. I began to wonder if I would see J again that night. I asked R what I should do and he said something like &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t fuck a different chick man, make her your temple&amp;#39;. As he had never given me bad advice, I had no choice but to listen! He had also told me to go up behind her and smack her ass and say &amp;#39;damn I had a good time last night&amp;#39; and walk away. It would&amp;#39;ve been hilarious to do that, but it was too vulgar for me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After a quick water break with R, my eyes finally spotted J on the other site of the rave. The colors still looking magnificent and everything seeming surreal, I strutted my way across to J not knowing what to expect. I came up behind her and was greeted instantly with a huge grin, with a big bear hug. I was stoked that things were going really well!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My &amp;#39;parents&amp;#39; had soon come to us and they stole J from me like a bunch of ninjas. They only took her a couple meters away, but I could hear what they were saying. They told her they were my parents and she had the most confused look on her face I&amp;#39;ve ever seen! She was absolutely clueless. While D (a guy from another camp, who had tried acid for the first time) had given me an enormous hug and said &amp;#39;man, I fucking love you!&amp;#39; This was fucking great! Euphoria is really indescribable but this is one of the closest examples that had happened there! That night he had been going up to everybody he knew and did the exact same thing to them, he had even tried to kiss &amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;! Anyways. I was reunited with J after having a big group photo, which seemed like a family portrait! I haltingly explained that they weren&amp;#39;t my parents and that they were just saying that because they assumed responsibility over me. She kind of understood but I re-explained it to her later.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We continued to dance like our lives depended on it. I literally had people from my camp running up to me to give me water and gum. I loved how they were so concerned for me, it made me feel like the greatest person in the world.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "A little while after, J asks me if I want to smoke a bowl. I yelled &amp;#39;sure!&amp;#39; On the way out of the dance area, I saw R, and I have him an epic high five. It was so epic it seemed like it had created a shock wave. We went to the big open field where lazers and trippy images on the screens were. We smoked and I offered J and her friend some MDMA because I had more than plenty. Her friend said no because she had to drive tomorrow. I loaded the MDMA onto a Kleenex for J. We had still been passing the pipe around smoking like chimneys. I was incredibly high. The music was incredibly different and sounded like it was the best thing my ears have ever listened to. As well as colours just looked a lot more vibrant and incredible! She took the MDMA and said &amp;#39;thanks for the MDMA&amp;#39;. We then sat there for about 20 minutes. During this time, we had begun cuddling in the middle of the field, soon leading to us kissing, and then making out. Soon enough we were going all out. I had even started to touch in inappropriate places, she then said something which I&amp;#39;m unclear of but all I know is she wanted me to stop.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We soon went back to the music and dancing again. Still feeling incredibly euphoric and all the effects as before, if not even stronger than before. I felt really connected to this girl, as if she was my girlfriend. After dancing for about 30 minutes or so. We went back to sit down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting for a little bit I turned to J as we were cuddling and said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m tired&amp;#39; because I started to get tired and my legs were KILLING me as I had been dancing for hours and hours every day. She replied saying &amp;#39;me too&amp;#39;. I then raised the question &amp;#39;do you want to head back?&amp;#39; and she said &amp;#39;sure&amp;#39;. It was still dark out and I&amp;#39;m thinking this was about 4 am in the morning. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We arrived at my tent which was about a ten minute walk and both went in comfortably. This is the latest I had arrived to my tent all weekend and I was kind of excited to go to sleep early. Little did I know, I soon found us having sex. It was the best sex I have ever had in my life. I could definitely still feel the effects of the drugs. I could literally feel the bass from my tent, which gives you an idea of how loud the music really was. Touching felt AMAZING and sex, well, I can&amp;#39;t begin to explain how great it felt!! It was ten times better than usual! After going at it for awhile and getting comfortable. I realized that it is very difficult to orgasm while on ecstasy/mushrooms, I knew this because I had noticed the sun was coming up and the music turned off (music turns off at 6 am) and we were still having sex, while she finally began to orgasm around this time. We had eventually stopped, not because of one another having an orgasm, but instead because we were really sweaty and exhausted! After soon falling asleep together too tired to put clothes back on.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That morning I made sure I had her number and I had walked her back to her campsite and gave her a good bye hug and kiss.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all, this weekend was a true, spiritual experience.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I have had an epiphany that life is too short to be shy and timid. I now have conversations with strangers everyday, without any awkward pauses or anything! It&amp;#39;s great and I think I may have lost my ego this entire weekend and it has yet to return.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "J and I are still talking everyday and everything is going super well. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "This was my first rave, and definitely is not my last!&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                \n",
       "Pre-Experience: MDMA/Ecstasy 3 times. LSD 2 times. Alchohol, drunk like 5 times (I don&amp;#39;t really enjoy it very much), weed smoked quite a bit, but recently quit for a month or two.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Setting: This whole experience happened at a rave at a camp site, which lasted at total of 4 days (music was on for 3).\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 1 (no music yet)\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My friend had asked me to go to this rave festival with him. I was a little skeptical about it being my first rave ever. So I thought on it and decided to go with him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The night we arrived it was a little sketchy at first but funny in the same sense. I was greeted by my &amp;#39;Mom and Dad&amp;#39;, my &amp;#39;mom&amp;#39; with a big hug as soon we pulled into the camp site and she blasted &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m your mom for the weekend and Mic is your dad!&amp;#39; Mom was very drunk by this point (I was under-age and I needed somebody over 18 to ensure I&amp;#39;d be okay) and she soon says, I can do drugs but I just have to be safe about it (water, rest, food etc). She guided my friend to his parking spot for the weekend which was hilarious, she was yelling and bossing C (my friend) to basically have the perfect park job!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Then Mic (&amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;) came to the site of my passenger door where I was sitting. He shook my hand for like 10-20 seconds, which seemed like a very long handshake. He had been trying to intimidate me for fun I believe. I was a little sketched out but in the end he was one of the nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That night I met everybody. I&amp;#39;m a rather shy person so I didn&amp;#39;t say much to them. My friend and I tried to set up the tent ASAP because night was starting to fall and I needed a place to sleep. After struggling and failing for about an hour, night finally fell and we decided to just give up and that I would sleep in the van for the night. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I just marinated at the epic camp site for the rest of the night. The campers had set up basically the greatest decorations in all of the festival. So colorful and beautiful and just down right perfect!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Chilling on the lawn chairs with a bunch of my fellow campers who I soon became acquainted with. They seemed like the chillest down to earth people I&amp;#39;d ever met. My friend soon went to go to bed in the van while I stayed out and talked with my friends. My new friend R, packed a hookah and told me to start smoking, so I did. Later we eventually put hash into the bowl and it was great! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was sitting beside this girl (who goes by the name of Dragon) who asked her, I think what was her boyfriend, &amp;#39;is your world looking straight and narrow?&amp;#39; he replies with &amp;#39;no&amp;#39;. Dragon replies with &amp;#39;not a good answer&amp;#39;. So she pulls out this white powder with a little spoon like thing and takes out a little powder on it and holds it out for her BF to snort. At this point I was like &amp;#39;wtf is going on here?!&amp;#39; in my head. Somebody soon asks what was it and she replies &amp;#39;ketamine&amp;#39;. I&amp;#39;d never even heard of it before so I asked asked and it sounded intense. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the DJs had been camping with us (I didn&amp;#39;t realize til he was on stage) and he was asking for drugs from anybody. Dragon pulls out the ketamine and the DJ asks if he can have some. She pulls out a hit for him and he smells it like a flower. He soon replies still snorting with his nose &amp;#39;What was that by the way?&amp;#39; I thought that it was crazy and hardcore that he didn&amp;#39;t even know what he had done til after. I soon went to bed after.\r\n",

       "Day 2 (Music festival starting up)\r\n",
       "\n",
       "First thing in the morning my friend and I finally set up the tent. I had brought two hits of acid and planned on doing one of them later in the day and my friend C would do one as well. We went to where they were setting up stages and just sat in the shade for a long time. My friend was trying to make me take my acid early (it was 2PM) and I wanted to do it at about 5 or 6 so I would be able to be awake all night no problem. After arguing for about 30 - 60 minutes about when to take it I told him I took it at about 2:30 (I didn&amp;#39;t take it yet). He said he would take it an hour and a half after I did. We walked back to camp, I was pretending to be feeling it a little. Then eventually headed back to the music.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "On the way to the music we smoked a bowl of weed and that&amp;#39;s when I snuck the LSD into my mouth (about 3:30 pm? I had no track of time this whole thing so I&amp;#39;m guessing). He then took his about 30 minutes later. We walked down to the little pond thing and crossed the bridge. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were reunited with some of our fellow campers and a bunch of others. I told them I was on acid and they were all like nice, we have to get some for ourselves too. This is where I started to trip balls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had packed about 2 more bowls and passed it around. I felt a shift in atmosphere but I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what exactly was changing. Eventually we left the people I didn&amp;#39;t really know and it was the campers and I. We moved closer to the music and some went back to camp to look for LSD. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "They all came back saying they took their acid and we just marinated on the grass by the main stage, staring at things, intrigued with how everything looked more beautiful and how everything had been starting to melt. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "It was eventually just a girl and I together somehow and we just lay by each other, discussing everything we see and what&amp;#39;s happening in each others minds. This seemed to be one of the most epic things and I felt really connected to this girl. We laid and stared at trees. Things had seemed to be blooming. Trees would grow outwards and then blossom with flowers on the tips, and then those flowers would slowly blossom towards me!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We eventually went and sat on the the other side of the pond thing where we were pretty much secluded from everybody but could still see everything. We still lay and sit there chatting about the usual.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon later, my friend K, had run up to us with a water gun and two kids about 7 years old who both had water guns. They started chasing us and shooting us with water guns. This was a little irritating considering I was not in the mind set to deal with kids. But it took a quick turn around. It soon felt like I was a kid again, it was exactly like playing tag when I was in elementary school! Being chased around by the 3 people was one of the most coolest experiences to happen at the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P (the girl I felt connected with), C, and I started to book it back to the campsite which had to be about 3 or 4 football fields away. The kids were still chasing us!! And they managed to keep up some how. I was outstanded, thrilled and a little scared too. These kids were on a mission and it was to get us wet!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The kids caught up to us and finally used up all their water after about an hour! It was a terrific accomplishment finally being able to sit and just enjoy.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By now I was just starting to peak and I had been tripping out so hard! I sat by my new friend R, who was giving me advice on how to take an acid trip. While he was explaining I remember just looking up at the trees, and things changed color and texture for a brief about 5 seconds. In this little while I had forgotten who I was.  R is one of the smartest people I know and have met! He has the best advice anybody has ever given me. It&amp;#39;s unbelievable!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had experienced a bad trip before, and I told him I experienced an &amp;#39;ego death&amp;#39; which he later told me was &amp;#39;Ego Freedom&amp;#39;. He was saying stuff like, if you start to have a bad trip just remember, that its like sitting in a canoe going down a river. All you need to do is tell yourself that and you&amp;#39;ll be fine. What ever you see going down that river will eventually be behind you and don&amp;#39;t let one bad idea spiral into a nightmare. He also said that LSD is a big head game with yourself, sure you can be with other friends but when it comes down to it, its just you, within your mind! I was so stoked on how smart R was and how great of a friend I made him this festival!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He eventually went to the stage where I just laid on the blanket outside on our site and just tripped out for awhile. Trees and other nature were still blooming and blossoming before my eyes. As well the world had began to feel like I was a cartoon living in a cartoon world. Nothing looked, or seemed real in the slightest. My reality was shattered. Later heading back to the music where I met up with P again. Night had fallen I believe. It&amp;#39;s hard to remember everything - I was tripping balls. Then I seemed to lose everybody but P, so we were together the entire night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We started to dance and I was loving it. She soon says she doesn&amp;#39;t want to dance so I said we can go for a walk and chill. The both of us walked and went on an adventure on a random path.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I held her hand on the way there. She looks at me and says &amp;#39;what&amp;#39;re you doing?&amp;#39; (Something like that, I&amp;#39;m unsure.) I apologize instantly and realize she doesn&amp;#39;t want anything. While walking she eventually grabs my hand about 10 minutes later. I was surprised and didn&amp;#39;t know what to think.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Ends up we walked around the whole camp site and ended back up at the main desk/pond. We found a really nice spot to lay down and look at the stars and the ravers in the distance. She tells me how it&amp;#39;s weird, she said she&amp;#39;s usually one of the ravers just going to the music.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I still relaxing on the grass. Enjoying the music and the comfort of each other, gazing into the stars. We realize dark clouds are slowly drifting on top of us. I suggest that a storm may be coming possibly.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Everything had become very calm, cool and still. It was the calm before the storm. The storm seemed like a hurricane on the prairies! I&amp;#39;ve never seen so much rain fall in my life. P and I decided to go sit under a tree thinking we could wait out the storm, but it just got worse and worse. The storm was raining through all the trees and we were getting soaked! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We decided to go up the stairs by the main office where it was dry. While on the way up to the stairs we found L, a friend/camper! He had done acid for his first time and was also very drunk, he was hysterical! Upon walking up the stairs, which had literally looked like a water fall now, flowing like niagra falls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "At the top, soaked. L says &amp;#39;so is the party over&amp;#39; I couldn&amp;#39;t hold back but to laugh! He was standing in the rain, in a puddle, under a gutter!! He could not have gotten anymore wet, he was using the gutter as if it were a shower and was dancing in the puddle.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The storm had eventually passed and we went to go check the aftermath of the storm. The main stage had been demolished. I was super bummed! It was such a dope stage! We eventually went back to the spot where we had been sitting. And there was an enormous tree branch that had fallen as well as many other small ones! Just about 2 meters away, that is crazy!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "P and I go to sit on the big stair by the pond and star gaze again. We see a star that looks significantly different from all the rest. Both of us begin talking, suggesting that its a UFO, P starts to cry out of joy and confusion and amazement. I feel incredibly connected to her. We were both in the same mind set, thinking we were seeing one of the wonders of the world. After about an hour or 2 of watching this star. We finally come to the realization that its a planet and it looks so different because its reflecting the sun!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Feeling kind of tired, I tell P and she says she has MDMA we could have. I thought that it was a great idea so we headed back to camp. The stage was working now, but there was no visuals at the time. We grab a bunch of MDMA. 3 of us snort some of it (my first time snorting it). K also snorted some (friend/camper). We had also grabbed some alcohol to drink.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally arriving at the main stage, about an hour or two from sunrise, we begin to dance. I see a lot of familiar faces on the dance floor. Such as R! He had a 7 foot stick with an inflatable heart at the top of it. This looked so fucking epic and awesome! I loved it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had entered a trance where there was no way I could stop dancing! Soon doing more MDMA. My memory is a little foggy after this. But I remember I danced till sunrise. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "4 others and I headed back to camp to grab a blanket and go to the pond to watch the sun rise. Quickly coming to the realization that we are all tired and want to sleep. We went back to home (camp) and slept.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 3\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Not too much happened during the day. I talked with everybody about last evening. There was now an awkwardness between P and I for some unknown reason which remained the rest of the festival.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Also I took R&amp;#39;s heart he had on his stick and held it to me, later suggesting that it would be cool to tape it to my chest! Which we instantly did, I felt like I belonged there now. The heart symbolizing connection between everyone which is how I felt the festival was!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That day I talked about shrooms to everyone and was unsure if I should try them as I had not done the before. I asked R for advice and he said I should try them. So I went and got 1 gram of Chocolate covered mushrooms.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "By this point I was shit-faced! Shortly after, I ate the mush. It put the entire thing in my mouth. It was way too much to handle in one bite, but I managed to chew it down anyway. It was a thick dry milk chocolate and you could taste the mushrooms very slightly, it was although it was eating chocolate with nuts in it.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We headed to the dance floor. I was feeling a slight shift in my reality. Once again, I couldn&amp;#39;t put my finger on what it was! We walked as a big group down. I was walking beside R. I was chatting with him saying how he&amp;#39;s so smart and gives the best advice! I asked if I could call him my shaman, as that is how I felt about him, anything I wondered or needed to know, he knew! Even when I didn&amp;#39;t ask. He replied with yes and I was super stoked!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "On arrival I drink a bit of my alcohol that I brought with me to the dance. I was definitely still wasted and now tripping a little bit from shrooms. After losing almost everybody except C I was bummed out and decided to sit by the pond. I felt like passing out; I was not having a good time. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I pretty much sat around for an hour or two alone until the alchohol wore off so I actually felt amazing after! Colors simply looked out of this world. It was like I had been color blind and I was seeing colors for the first time ever, colors were simply beautiful! I also has a huge body stone, which felt a bit like MDMA but my body felt more numb. I was still once again looking for others! I could not find ANYBODY! I did not know what to do and I was panicking a bit. But soon came to the realization that I can always meet new friends and just enjoy life! They had also redone the stage and it was as good as new! The stage once again looked phenomenal!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "This concept was a bit difficult for me usually as I am a shy person, but when I was on mushrooms, drunk, and high from weed. It came as though it was a natural gift I soon possessed. I went to the very front of the speakers and started to dance. I had practiced shuffling before, but once again! It just came naturally now.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was having the best time of my life! I had become the music. I felt as though everybody was my family and that we were all at harmony! I danced for a couple hours till I finally found some people I knew from camp.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had not had water the whole time and I was soaking wet with sweat! I saw R and one of the first words that came out of my mouth was, water! He reacted as fast as he could to get my water. I was amazed at this simple but yet amazing gesture! I soon told him what was happening and he said we should go sit down and relax as I had been over heating. We had very intellectual conversations. He was telling me how he used to have a drug problem and how he is as a person.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He said he&amp;#39;s terrific at helping others out with their problems but when it comes to his own, sometimes he struggles deeply. I was shocked as he was one of the smartest and nicest people I&amp;#39;ve ever met. He told me that J had been his shaman, like he was to me (a girl who we were camping with). He was trying to say I understand what you&amp;#39;re going through and I&amp;#39;m there for you bro. R eventually says that kids usually fuck up with drugs, but I can handle it really well and that he wants to go into big brothers big sisters. I felt incredible for him and I encouraged him to do it! Even I wish I could have him for a big bro. He wants to show kids that fuck up with drugs that you don&amp;#39;t need to take 9 pills to have a good time or 12 grams of shrooms. It just takes a little. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "After out heart to heart talk, he had the brilliant idea that we should put the inflatable heart on my back and not my chest because it gets in the way of dancing , especially dancing with girls.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon after doing so I started dancing again. I asked him for tips on trying to find a girl there as I couldn&amp;#39;t find one I was attracted to! Once again, it came as no surprise, he gave the greatest advice ever!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "R told me to just go find a spot where I was comfortable, close my eyes and just let the music do its part, just lose myself within the music. And when I open my eyes, I&amp;#39;d lock eyes with a girl and everything would be great. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Oddly enough, I did exactly as he said, and guess what!? I locked eyes with a girl and we soon began dancing with each other! She was one of the cutest girls at the whole thing, a little raver girl wearing a mini skirt, furry boots, bikini top, and a cat hat that looked really sexy! I was shocked at how good of advice R gives, like, it&amp;#39;s insane! \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I was feeling euphoric for probably one of the first times ever. It felt like absolutely everybody was my best friend and that there was no ice to break. This was a little odd to me because I&amp;#39;m a shy timid person around new people, especially adults. It was the greatest feeling I&amp;#39;ve ever felt! I cannot even explain how terrific this felt. Just feeling the love of everybody, at complete unity and peace with one another as human beings! I&amp;#39;d smile at somebody, they&amp;#39;d smile back. I was shuffling and almost instantly I found other shufflers around me, shuffling with me! It was incredible and unreal. I almost could not believe this was happening. I was shuffling in sync with others and we would take turns, I truly discovered what it was like to lose your ego at this point. I didn&amp;#39;t care what anybody looked like but only the connection we shared. It legitimately felt like everybody was at one huge family at a reunion!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After dancing the night away, most of the crowd had disappeared into the fog of the night. I told J (the girl I had been dancing with) that I was tired. She instantly concurred with me and I asked if we should head back. We started to head back and I asked what she did tonight. She had done acid and smoked weed which was cool and would have been a blast as well.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got to my tent where we went in to the tent and there was no way we were going to sleep. After dancing with her all night, I felt connect and incredibly attracted to her, there was no holding back. I soon found us having sex! The sex was incredible. It&amp;#39;s inevitable to explain how great everything was. I didn&amp;#39;t have a single worry in the world and I could not be happier!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Day 4 (final day of music)\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Later that morning I saw J leave but I was still asleep. I woke up later that morning thinking to myself I&amp;#39;d never see her again and I was kind of bummed as she was from the same city I was and I thought we could have been friends.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had bought more shrooms for the night today and I still had an entire vial of MDMA. Not too much happened during the day so I&amp;#39;m going to skip to night.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That night I took the mushrooms and took about an eighth of the MDMA which isn&amp;#39;t a lot but it seemed to do wonders! I&amp;#39;d like to start off by saying I have never been higher in my life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I took the mushrooms and right after parachuted the MDMA. I didn&amp;#39;t really know what to expect as this was the first time I had ever &amp;#39;hippie flipped&amp;#39;. I started to feel a shift in reality as usual. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "I had arrived to the dance floor and everything began to look amazing. The lights looked mesmerizing. The bass from the music became my heartbeat. My body was feeling numb but at peace. I had the giggles like I want a young baby and I felt butterfly like feelings inside my stomach which in turn made me smile and I couldn&amp;#39;t stop! Things started to look like they were from a 3D pop out book. I remember I walked by this tree a ton and it just looked more and more different every time. It just seemed to POP out at me! This had been the greatest I have felt in my entire life! I don&amp;#39;t remember a point in the night where I was not smiling. I was the happiest person in the world!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Dancing for an hour or so. I began to wonder if I would see J again that night. I asked R what I should do and he said something like &amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t fuck a different chick man, make her your temple&amp;#39;. As he had never given me bad advice, I had no choice but to listen! He had also told me to go up behind her and smack her ass and say &amp;#39;damn I had a good time last night&amp;#39; and walk away. It would&amp;#39;ve been hilarious to do that, but it was too vulgar for me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After a quick water break with R, my eyes finally spotted J on the other site of the rave. The colors still looking magnificent and everything seeming surreal, I strutted my way across to J not knowing what to expect. I came up behind her and was greeted instantly with a huge grin, with a big bear hug. I was stoked that things were going really well!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "My &amp;#39;parents&amp;#39; had soon come to us and they stole J from me like a bunch of ninjas. They only took her a couple meters away, but I could hear what they were saying. They told her they were my parents and she had the most confused look on her face I&amp;#39;ve ever seen! She was absolutely clueless. While D (a guy from another camp, who had tried acid for the first time) had given me an enormous hug and said &amp;#39;man, I fucking love you!&amp;#39; This was fucking great! Euphoria is really indescribable but this is one of the closest examples that had happened there! That night he had been going up to everybody he knew and did the exact same thing to them, he had even tried to kiss &amp;#39;dad&amp;#39;! Anyways. I was reunited with J after having a big group photo, which seemed like a family portrait! I haltingly explained that they weren&amp;#39;t my parents and that they were just saying that because they assumed responsibility over me. She kind of understood but I re-explained it to her later.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We continued to dance like our lives depended on it. I literally had people from my camp running up to me to give me water and gum. I loved how they were so concerned for me, it made me feel like the greatest person in the world.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "A little while after, J asks me if I want to smoke a bowl. I yelled &amp;#39;sure!&amp;#39; On the way out of the dance area, I saw R, and I have him an epic high five. It was so epic it seemed like it had created a shock wave. We went to the big open field where lazers and trippy images on the screens were. We smoked and I offered J and her friend some MDMA because I had more than plenty. Her friend said no because she had to drive tomorrow. I loaded the MDMA onto a Kleenex for J. We had still been passing the pipe around smoking like chimneys. I was incredibly high. The music was incredibly different and sounded like it was the best thing my ears have ever listened to. As well as colours just looked a lot more vibrant and incredible! She took the MDMA and said &amp;#39;thanks for the MDMA&amp;#39;. We then sat there for about 20 minutes. During this time, we had begun cuddling in the middle of the field, soon leading to us kissing, and then making out. Soon enough we were going all out. I had even started to touch in inappropriate places, she then said something which I&amp;#39;m unclear of but all I know is she wanted me to stop.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We soon went back to the music and dancing again. Still feeling incredibly euphoric and all the effects as before, if not even stronger than before. I felt really connected to this girl, as if she was my girlfriend. After dancing for about 30 minutes or so. We went back to sit down.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting for a little bit I turned to J as we were cuddling and said &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m tired&amp;#39; because I started to get tired and my legs were KILLING me as I had been dancing for hours and hours every day. She replied saying &amp;#39;me too&amp;#39;. I then raised the question &amp;#39;do you want to head back?&amp;#39; and she said &amp;#39;sure&amp;#39;. It was still dark out and I&amp;#39;m thinking this was about 4 am in the morning. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We arrived at my tent which was about a ten minute walk and both went in comfortably. This is the latest I had arrived to my tent all weekend and I was kind of excited to go to sleep early. Little did I know, I soon found us having sex. It was the best sex I have ever had in my life. I could definitely still feel the effects of the drugs. I could literally feel the bass from my tent, which gives you an idea of how loud the music really was. Touching felt AMAZING and sex, well, I can&amp;#39;t begin to explain how great it felt!! It was ten times better than usual! After going at it for awhile and getting comfortable. I realized that it is very difficult to orgasm while on ecstasy/mushrooms, I knew this because I had noticed the sun was coming up and the music turned off (music turns off at 6 am) and we were still having sex, while she finally began to orgasm around this time. We had eventually stopped, not because of one another having an orgasm, but instead because we were really sweaty and exhausted! After soon falling asleep together too tired to put clothes back on.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That morning I made sure I had her number and I had walked her back to her campsite and gave her a good bye hug and kiss.\r\n",

       "All in all, this weekend was a true, spiritual experience.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I have had an epiphany that life is too short to be shy and timid. I now have conversations with strangers everyday, without any awkward pauses or anything! It&amp;#39;s great and I think I may have lost my ego this entire weekend and it has yet to return.\r\n",

For the most part, my trips have been recreational, pretty colors, giggling fits, etc., with mild spiritual overtones. I partly attribute this to my lack of preparation. Eating a handful of mushrooms just because I have the night off and nothing else to do doesn&amp;#39;t seem to facilitate a profound experience.\r\n",

V picked me up around 4:00pm, and we headed down to the magical ranch. We arrived at close to 5:00pm and got our wristbands. We found a parking spot near a tall palm tree with a light shining behind it, the beacon and landmark that would guide us back. We talked to Vs friend who told me about homeopathic medicine.\r\n",

       "After walking around and looking at the stages, we sat in the car and listened to music. I played Juan Verdera - Spiritual Healing. At 9:00pm, I decided I was ready for some knowledge. I got out my 1/8 oz of mushrooms and gave V a few stems, then ate the rest (save for a few stems) washed down with pomegranate limeade. We lit some St. Jude incense to guide us, and then walked down to the psytrance stage to dance. I got a text message from S asking if anyone has extra tickets to the party or if he could sneak in. I told V about it and being the nice person he is, he said Lets go ask E if we can let him in, so we walked to the ticketing area, but no luck. I started to feel strange and a little nauseous, and we started walking back to the stage area. Security stopped us and said we cant walk back, and we have to ride in someones car. Luckily, Vs friend T and her friend were just about to park and gave us a ride. I could feel the journey beginning, and riding around the car felt like being on a psychedelic tour ride.\r\n",

V laughed and said Dude, youre tripping her out, she just ate a bunch of mushrooms! I told V I felt nauseous and worried that I ate too much, and he said Lets go back to the car, when I take shrooms, I like to just sit back and close my eyes for about 45 minutes. I told him I was scared, and asked how to end the trip, knowing that I couldnt. V said You cant stop it, just enjoy it while it lasts.\r\n",

       "We got in the car and I closed my eyes and covered them with my hands. I wanted to say something about the beautiful patterns I was seeing. They looked like Alex Grey paintings morphing and changing, like the inside walls and stained glass windows of a cathedral. Then I heard the rumbling bass of the music, and a loud, rumbling voice, which I knew to be God, said in a very serious tone, Don&amp;#39;t speak, everything you say now must be intelligent. So I didn&amp;#39;t say anything for a while, and when I began to speak, there was a marked change in my vocabulary, almost like God was speaking through me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "V and I both needed to go to the bathroom, so we walked to the VIP restrooms by the mansion. I looked at the trees and plants, and they seemed like people to me, like they had minds and could understand my words. I hugged some trees and plants as I would hug a person. We passed by a camp of tents, and under a stream of holiday lights hanging above us. We started to laugh about something and I stopped worrying so much, when suddenly in my head I heard God say, Just enjoy life. I said, V, God just told me, to enjoy life. V said Are you going to listen? and I said yes. Later we named that spot the Joy of Life spot. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got to the restrooms and there was a fire pit nearby. I stood by it and looked at the beautiful flames, streaked with purple. I knew that fire was Gods creation, and its warmth was his gift and embrace. As we waited in line for the restroom, I saw a man wash his hands and I said, V, that man was washing his hands",
       "  V began to laugh  and it looked like he was creating some intricate hand art. Then we both couldnt stop laughing, and I said And God said, just enjoy life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We started walking back to the stage area. As we walked down the stairs, we saw P, who greeted us and as he waved goodbye, he spun around in a dance-like fashion. I started laughing and said V, did you see the dance P did? The P dance! He said No, how did he do it? and I showed him and said He looked like a little wizard or Mickey Mouse! We laughed hysterically for a while and I said And God said, enjoy life. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "As we walked back, I said Where shall we go V? and he said Where do you want to go? I said I want to go where you want to go, because I sometimes feel like I tell people too much what to do, and I dont want to do that. We passed by a large white dome with a holograph projector creating moving art within, and V asked if I wanted to go inside. I did, and I told him he must have read the mental text message I sent him, because I wanted him to suggest going there instead of me telling him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got inside and sat by two Rasta guys (dreadlocks, Jamaican-influenced style), and then T and her friend entered the dome and sat with us. T asked how my journey was going, and I told her that God talked to me, and immediately after, I regretted saying this, as she looked skeptical. A few minutes later, we started laughing about something, and I erupted in a hysterical fit of laughter, which made me fall back onto a pillow. I started thinking of how wasted I was acting and how I must look in my mothers and Gods eyes, and started to feel guilty. Then I imagined all of the problems of the world, dating back to ancient history, and I began to cry. I erupted in tears and couldnt stop crying and saying Im sorry, Im so sorry! V held my hand and the Rasta guy hugged me and said something very spiritual involving forgiveness. As I was lying down and crying, T asked the guys How would you explain mushrooms to someone who hasnt taken them? Everyone else said they couldnt explain it, but I answered Taking mushrooms is like knowing everything about the universe and its problems, more than you could ever want to know, all in your head at once.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "When I finally stopped crying, the Rasta guy did a chant to bless me and keep bad energies away. I started to sense my own psychic abilities, and told the group to ask me something, anything, and maybe I will know the answer. T said Who was Coltan in my past life? I closed my eyes and thought. The name Coltan reminded me of sultan and I pictured a bazaar with a vendor trying to sell something to a lady who was presumably T. I told her this, and said that his name sounds like sultan so he must have had ancestors who were sultans. Next, it was Ts friends turn to ask me something, and after a while she said What will happen in 2012? I closed my eyes and waited for the message to come. I said There will be greater understanding and acceptance among people in 2012. She said I hope so.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "V and I were ready to return to the psytrance stage to greet the new year. Someone there told me that 2012 is the year of the dragon according to the Chinese zodiac. I remembered that my zodiac sign is that of the dragon, and I realized that 2012 is my year. I thought, God must have planned for me to have this very experience, on this very night. As we all danced, I saw trails of peoples hands and bodies and could sense their energies, troubles, and thoughts. There was a moment when I could sense Vs internal sadness and I gave him I hug. I said V, I could sense you needed a hug and he was amazed that I knew this. We saw A on the dance floor, and I kept forgetting his name, so I just called him Vs twin. I told A that I had eaten mushrooms and to ask me a question and maybe I will know the answer. He said What is greater than God? I closed my eyes and when I opened them I told him, God says everything is greater than him",
       " hes very humble. A said Thats a good answer",
       " yeah, humble? I like that.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon, the countdown began, and when it was 2012, V and I hugged and kissed each other on the cheek. I said V, I think we need to feed you some knowledge now that its the new year and your soul is ready. He laughed and said ok, so we headed back to the car.\r\n",
       "We stopped by the restroom again and as we waited in line, V did the P dance and I saw a blue light around him. I said V, you have a beautiful blue spirit light. He stopped and looked at me and said, You know, according to the Mayan calendar, my color is blue? I told him I would have to look up what the color blue means in terms of spirit lights, as well as the meaning of his name. I had a feeling his name was associated with a saint. I told him there are a lot of messages God sends us through Google and through little pockets of energy in the environment, which are absorbed by our subconscious minds. He said You want to know what I think about God? This shirt is God, the ground is God",
       " everything is made of God. In the restroom I thought about this, and when I came out, I told V All religions are the same, but how do we create an explanation that combines all of the different religions without causing conflict? We both agreed that the only way for people to understand that all religions are the same is through each person having his/her own psychedelic experience. As we walked back to the car, we passed the Joy of Life spot and I said And God said, just enjoy life!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We passed by K who again said So, do you really like this guy? and we laughed. As V talked to K, I danced around and thought about my friend R and how Rs name and spirit is similar to a ray of sunshine, and saw that R must have a yellow spirit light. I thought of how R said I am like a delicate flower, and thought that is how God sees me too. I then realized my purpose in life is to be a flower and absorb energies and information, but I thought, what does a flower do with all this information? V said to pollinate? and I said, Yes, to spread knowledge and help many people, maybe to find the cure for something",
       " and V said the cure for unhappiness.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Inside the car, we talked some more, and I told V hes a good person with a beautiful blue spirit light, and he cares about people but sometimes hes too hard on himself and he shouldnt be. I gave him another mushroom stem to eat and we talked more. He asked Can I ask, if you dont mind",
       " why dont you like boys or girls? I thought about it and said, I think because God made me that way",
       " I think he has another purpose for me, to help many people, and devoting myself to one person would take away the time and energy I need to accomplish my lifes purpose. V said I think you just want to love everyone, and people sometimes want it all for themselves, and they cant understand you",
       " but when they get to know you, they will see that you just love everyone. I asked V how do I make everyone happy, and he said to just be happy myself and smile, and when people see me smile, they will say Thats a happy girl right there and they will smile and be happy too. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We also talked about the nature of selfishness and how people are naturally a bit selfish, including myself, as I keep wanting my mom to move and be with me although I know she has her own life. V said I have to let my mom live her own life and the physical distance between me and my mom wont lessen the connection my mom and I have. I saw that my mom has a gold spirit energy, which made sense, as she always said I had golden hands. I also contemplated that maybe I dont like my step-sister because I felt like she is closer (in terms of distance) to my mom, or maybe my step-sisters spirit energy and my spirit energy are incompatible and end up criss-crossing in the physical world. I also thought about S and why he seems a bit strange to me, and I thought, hes not a bad person but maybe he has too many negative energies stuck to him, like burrs stick to fur. Vs spirit, on the other hand, doesnt let the bad energies stick to him. Instead, they just brush past him, still affecting him, but not lingering. V told me that the moment when I hugged him on the dance floor was right after his ex-girlfriend had passed by. I also thought about how physical and emotional illness must be the physical manifestation of peoples subconscious absorbing too much information and energy, as their body/mind cant process all of that information at once. Thus, during a psychedelic experience, you have to focus on one thing at a time and just listen to the message.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of visual effects, I often saw snowflake patterns, especially on the grass, and the stars looked like a lattice enveloping the earth. Fireworks were sparkling and beautiful. Looking at text, the words seemed to move. Moving hands and objects left trails. Sometimes I had double vision and it looked like some people had three or more eyes or chins. Peoples faces and costumes looked beautiful. I told Vs friend Eric, who was wearing a mask, that the visual art on his face was beautiful. The three of us sat by Vs car and talked about the psychedelic experience, aliens, energy, etc. I said I think aliens are just beings that have the knowledge that you have on mushrooms, except all of the time, and perhaps they are waiting for our people to become intelligent and open-minded enough to understand them before introducing themselves to us.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We went back to the psytrance stage, and I remembered that I wanted V to introduce me to his friend Y who I knew online. Just as I was thinking this, V saw one of his friends and then said to me, Lets go meet Y, hes here. I talked to Y and we walked past a dubstep stage. It was the first time that I really began to appreciate dubstep music. I realized that the reason it was hard for me to appreciate it before was that there were too many sounds to process in my mind, but now the mushrooms had expanded my mind and given me the ability to process all of the different sounds, energies, and information. I realized that everything in the universe is made of energy, and I finally understood the meaning of the lyrics of Infected Mushroom &amp;amp; Jorg - The Messenger: The secret of the world is that the world is made by words, so use your voice to make an object, thats what the psychedelic experience is. An object is made of energy and sound particles are made of energy, so you can use the sound energy of your voice to make an object.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I went back to the psytrance stage. While dancing, I saw a light coming from a corner near the stage. As I approached it, I saw someone painting a beautiful picture with eyes and intricate colorful patterns all over it. I sat and watched and the artist introduced himself, at which point I instantly recognized him from seeing his work online. I sat and looked through his portfolio, admiring all of the patterns and colors. I was feeling sleepy so I didnt get a chance to finish going through all of the artwork, but I told him I would come back to it. I went to Vs car to sleep, and found he was there sleeping as well. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We both woke up after sunrise, as the people camping next to us were talking loudly. We passed by the Joy of Life spot and a friend gave us some tea. We sat by the warm fire and drank the tea before heading back to the psytrance stage. We realized the music had stopped, and soon learned that the police had busted the party while we were asleep and shut down the music. However, soon the music was back on. I danced, talked, laughed, hugged, took pictures and videos, and enjoyed life. Later on, E, P, V, Y, and I smoked some changa (DMT), but surprisingly, both Y and I had no effects. I tried it again later on, and still nothing, but I didnt care. I had already gotten my psychedelic experience the night before, the most important night of my life.&quot;&gt;\n",
       "                \n",
       "I packed my bags and prepared for the journey ahead, but little did I know just how much this journey would change my life. V picked me up around 4:00pm, and we headed down to the magical ranch. We arrived at close to 5:00pm and got our wristbands. We found a parking spot near a tall palm tree with a light shining behind it, the beacon and landmark that would guide us back. We talked to Vs friend who told me about homeopathic medicine.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "After walking around and looking at the stages, we sat in the car and listened to music. I played Juan Verdera - Spiritual Healing. At 9:00pm, I decided I was ready for some knowledge. I got out my 1/8 oz of mushrooms and gave V a few stems, then ate the rest (save for a few stems) washed down with pomegranate limeade. We lit some St. Jude incense to guide us, and then walked down to the psytrance stage to dance. I got a text message from S asking if anyone has extra tickets to the party or if he could sneak in. I told V about it and being the nice person he is, he said Lets go ask E if we can let him in, so we walked to the ticketing area, but no luck. I started to feel strange and a little nauseous, and we started walking back to the stage area. Security stopped us and said we cant walk back, and we have to ride in someones car. Luckily, Vs friend T and her friend were just about to park and gave us a ride. I could feel the journey beginning, and riding around the car felt like being on a psychedelic tour ride.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "V and I got out and started walking when we were approached by K, who said So, do you like V? Do you really like him? I said Im not straight, dude! and he said in a gay tone, Like, ok! I told him to stop and said something like Im tripping and youre being a mean person and shoed him away with my hand. V laughed and said Dude, youre tripping her out, she just ate a bunch of mushrooms! I told V I felt nauseous and worried that I ate too much, and he said Lets go back to the car, when I take shrooms, I like to just sit back and close my eyes for about 45 minutes. I told him I was scared, and asked how to end the trip, knowing that I couldnt. V said You cant stop it, just enjoy it while it lasts.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got in the car and I closed my eyes and covered them with my hands. I wanted to say something about the beautiful patterns I was seeing. They looked like Alex Grey paintings morphing and changing, like the inside walls and stained glass windows of a cathedral. Then I heard the rumbling bass of the music, and a loud, rumbling voice, which I knew to be God, said in a very serious tone, Don&amp;#39;t speak, everything you say now must be intelligent. So I didn&amp;#39;t say anything for a while, and when I began to speak, there was a marked change in my vocabulary, almost like God was speaking through me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "V and I both needed to go to the bathroom, so we walked to the VIP restrooms by the mansion. I looked at the trees and plants, and they seemed like people to me, like they had minds and could understand my words. I hugged some trees and plants as I would hug a person. We passed by a camp of tents, and under a stream of holiday lights hanging above us. We started to laugh about something and I stopped worrying so much, when suddenly in my head I heard God say, Just enjoy life. I said, V, God just told me, to enjoy life. V said Are you going to listen? and I said yes. Later we named that spot the Joy of Life spot. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got to the restrooms and there was a fire pit nearby. I stood by it and looked at the beautiful flames, streaked with purple. I knew that fire was Gods creation, and its warmth was his gift and embrace. As we waited in line for the restroom, I saw a man wash his hands and I said, V, that man was washing his hands",
       "  V began to laugh  and it looked like he was creating some intricate hand art. Then we both couldnt stop laughing, and I said And God said, just enjoy life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We started walking back to the stage area. As we walked down the stairs, we saw P, who greeted us and as he waved goodbye, he spun around in a dance-like fashion. I started laughing and said V, did you see the dance P did? The P dance! He said No, how did he do it? and I showed him and said He looked like a little wizard or Mickey Mouse! We laughed hysterically for a while and I said And God said, enjoy life. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "As we walked back, I said Where shall we go V? and he said Where do you want to go? I said I want to go where you want to go, because I sometimes feel like I tell people too much what to do, and I dont want to do that. We passed by a large white dome with a holograph projector creating moving art within, and V asked if I wanted to go inside. I did, and I told him he must have read the mental text message I sent him, because I wanted him to suggest going there instead of me telling him.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We got inside and sat by two Rasta guys (dreadlocks, Jamaican-influenced style), and then T and her friend entered the dome and sat with us. T asked how my journey was going, and I told her that God talked to me, and immediately after, I regretted saying this, as she looked skeptical. A few minutes later, we started laughing about something, and I erupted in a hysterical fit of laughter, which made me fall back onto a pillow. I started thinking of how wasted I was acting and how I must look in my mothers and Gods eyes, and started to feel guilty. Then I imagined all of the problems of the world, dating back to ancient history, and I began to cry. I erupted in tears and couldnt stop crying and saying Im sorry, Im so sorry! V held my hand and the Rasta guy hugged me and said something very spiritual involving forgiveness. As I was lying down and crying, T asked the guys How would you explain mushrooms to someone who hasnt taken them? Everyone else said they couldnt explain it, but I answered Taking mushrooms is like knowing everything about the universe and its problems, more than you could ever want to know, all in your head at once.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "When I finally stopped crying, the Rasta guy did a chant to bless me and keep bad energies away. I started to sense my own psychic abilities, and told the group to ask me something, anything, and maybe I will know the answer. T said Who was Coltan in my past life? I closed my eyes and thought. The name Coltan reminded me of sultan and I pictured a bazaar with a vendor trying to sell something to a lady who was presumably T. I told her this, and said that his name sounds like sultan so he must have had ancestors who were sultans. Next, it was Ts friends turn to ask me something, and after a while she said What will happen in 2012? I closed my eyes and waited for the message to come. I said There will be greater understanding and acceptance among people in 2012. She said I hope so.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "V and I were ready to return to the psytrance stage to greet the new year. Someone there told me that 2012 is the year of the dragon according to the Chinese zodiac. I remembered that my zodiac sign is that of the dragon, and I realized that 2012 is my year. I thought, God must have planned for me to have this very experience, on this very night. As we all danced, I saw trails of peoples hands and bodies and could sense their energies, troubles, and thoughts. There was a moment when I could sense Vs internal sadness and I gave him I hug. I said V, I could sense you needed a hug and he was amazed that I knew this. We saw A on the dance floor, and I kept forgetting his name, so I just called him Vs twin. I told A that I had eaten mushrooms and to ask me a question and maybe I will know the answer. He said What is greater than God? I closed my eyes and when I opened them I told him, God says everything is greater than him",
       " hes very humble. A said Thats a good answer",
       " yeah, humble? I like that.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon, the countdown began, and when it was 2012, V and I hugged and kissed each other on the cheek. I said V, I think we need to feed you some knowledge now that its the new year and your soul is ready. He laughed and said ok, so we headed back to the car.\r\n",
       "We stopped by the restroom again and as we waited in line, V did the P dance and I saw a blue light around him. I said V, you have a beautiful blue spirit light. He stopped and looked at me and said, You know, according to the Mayan calendar, my color is blue? I told him I would have to look up what the color blue means in terms of spirit lights, as well as the meaning of his name. I had a feeling his name was associated with a saint. I told him there are a lot of messages God sends us through Google and through little pockets of energy in the environment, which are absorbed by our subconscious minds. He said You want to know what I think about God? This shirt is God, the ground is God",
       " everything is made of God. In the restroom I thought about this, and when I came out, I told V All religions are the same, but how do we create an explanation that combines all of the different religions without causing conflict? We both agreed that the only way for people to understand that all religions are the same is through each person having his/her own psychedelic experience. As we walked back to the car, we passed the Joy of Life spot and I said And God said, just enjoy life!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We passed by K who again said So, do you really like this guy? and we laughed. As V talked to K, I danced around and thought about my friend R and how Rs name and spirit is similar to a ray of sunshine, and saw that R must have a yellow spirit light. I thought of how R said I am like a delicate flower, and thought that is how God sees me too. I then realized my purpose in life is to be a flower and absorb energies and information, but I thought, what does a flower do with all this information? V said to pollinate? and I said, Yes, to spread knowledge and help many people, maybe to find the cure for something",
       " and V said the cure for unhappiness.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Inside the car, we talked some more, and I told V hes a good person with a beautiful blue spirit light, and he cares about people but sometimes hes too hard on himself and he shouldnt be. I gave him another mushroom stem to eat and we talked more. He asked Can I ask, if you dont mind",
       " why dont you like boys or girls? I thought about it and said, I think because God made me that way",
       " I think he has another purpose for me, to help many people, and devoting myself to one person would take away the time and energy I need to accomplish my lifes purpose. V said I think you just want to love everyone, and people sometimes want it all for themselves, and they cant understand you",
       " but when they get to know you, they will see that you just love everyone. I asked V how do I make everyone happy, and he said to just be happy myself and smile, and when people see me smile, they will say Thats a happy girl right there and they will smile and be happy too. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We also talked about the nature of selfishness and how people are naturally a bit selfish, including myself, as I keep wanting my mom to move and be with me although I know she has her own life. V said I have to let my mom live her own life and the physical distance between me and my mom wont lessen the connection my mom and I have. I saw that my mom has a gold spirit energy, which made sense, as she always said I had golden hands. I also contemplated that maybe I dont like my step-sister because I felt like she is closer (in terms of distance) to my mom, or maybe my step-sisters spirit energy and my spirit energy are incompatible and end up criss-crossing in the physical world. I also thought about S and why he seems a bit strange to me, and I thought, hes not a bad person but maybe he has too many negative energies stuck to him, like burrs stick to fur. Vs spirit, on the other hand, doesnt let the bad energies stick to him. Instead, they just brush past him, still affecting him, but not lingering. V told me that the moment when I hugged him on the dance floor was right after his ex-girlfriend had passed by. I also thought about how physical and emotional illness must be the physical manifestation of peoples subconscious absorbing too much information and energy, as their body/mind cant process all of that information at once. Thus, during a psychedelic experience, you have to focus on one thing at a time and just listen to the message.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of visual effects, I often saw snowflake patterns, especially on the grass, and the stars looked like a lattice enveloping the earth. Fireworks were sparkling and beautiful. Looking at text, the words seemed to move. Moving hands and objects left trails. Sometimes I had double vision and it looked like some people had three or more eyes or chins. Peoples faces and costumes looked beautiful. I told Vs friend Eric, who was wearing a mask, that the visual art on his face was beautiful. The three of us sat by Vs car and talked about the psychedelic experience, aliens, energy, etc. I said I think aliens are just beings that have the knowledge that you have on mushrooms, except all of the time, and perhaps they are waiting for our people to become intelligent and open-minded enough to understand them before introducing themselves to us.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We went back to the psytrance stage, and I remembered that I wanted V to introduce me to his friend Y who I knew online. Just as I was thinking this, V saw one of his friends and then said to me, Lets go meet Y, hes here. I talked to Y and we walked past a dubstep stage. It was the first time that I really began to appreciate dubstep music. I realized that the reason it was hard for me to appreciate it before was that there were too many sounds to process in my mind, but now the mushrooms had expanded my mind and given me the ability to process all of the different sounds, energies, and information. I realized that everything in the universe is made of energy, and I finally understood the meaning of the lyrics of Infected Mushroom &amp;amp; Jorg - The Messenger: The secret of the world is that the world is made by words, so use your voice to make an object, thats what the psychedelic experience is. An object is made of energy and sound particles are made of energy, so you can use the sound energy of your voice to make an object.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I went back to the psytrance stage. While dancing, I saw a light coming from a corner near the stage. As I approached it, I saw someone painting a beautiful picture with eyes and intricate colorful patterns all over it. I sat and watched and the artist introduced himself, at which point I instantly recognized him from seeing his work online. I sat and looked through his portfolio, admiring all of the patterns and colors. I was feeling sleepy so I didnt get a chance to finish going through all of the artwork, but I told him I would come back to it. I went to Vs car to sleep, and found he was there sleeping as well. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We both woke up after sunrise, as the people camping next to us were talking loudly. We passed by the Joy of Life spot and a friend gave us some tea. We sat by the warm fire and drank the tea before heading back to the psytrance stage. We realized the music had stopped, and soon learned that the police had busted the party while we were asleep and shut down the music. However, soon the music was back on.

       "Last saturday I met up with some friends and we decided to go party in the mountains of Costa Rica. We went up there, about 32 km away from the city, a perfect party place. It was about 2:00 pm, and we were all happy.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We set up the DJing equipment and immediately I came up with the idea of seeking shrooms since there are cows in the lawn. We didnt find any, as the excessive rain let little sun set the appropriate temperature for them to grow.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Frustrated as we were, we decided to drop some acid and party on. We did, and I dropped ½ a hit. I began DJing, mixing some stomping goa to warm us up. I did excellent mixes, by the way. A friend I met that day came up to me with some pills, Nootropil (Piracetam), said to have a powerful enhancement on psychotropic drugs such as acid. It is said to connect both brain hemispheres, thus multiplicating the visuals effects. He said that hallucinations are tens of times more intense, more vivid, and the rush of creativity is catapulted. One can experience a trip that will change ones life, as I did. I dropped 3 orange pills (Nootropil), hoping I would have a good trip. That friend told me they were actually great for the brain, it is given to Alzheimers so they can have mind clarity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "As I began to mix the stompiest goa I have, the effects kicked in. It was a good trip, the good vibes seemed to come from everywhere. I met a guy, and within two or three looks on the eye, I knew we would have a great trip together. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We seemed to focus on the same details of the trip, laughing at exactly the same things. Explosive laughter, which creates a chain reaction, you know? Sometimes I would try to explain something I thought or vice versa, and by saying 4 or 5 words he would perfectly understand. Lets say, I thought the sound of a really quiet mouse in the house was coming from under the ground, I would say something quite broken- such as did you hear that? and before I could finish he would come up with something like its an underground rabbit thats trying to run away from your mouse, and just because you heard it, doesnt mean its really there, cause maybe were just in a weird trip, and this would mean we need to go under the ground, because I feel some vibes are in there. Lets seek that mouse... wait a minute",
       ". And there we exploded in acid laughter. Everytime he said something, he made more sense, and vice-versa. Lets say his names Morg. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Hours later, we had discovered we were extremely attached to each other, and we were acting as One. At night, we decided to drop some xtc. I dropped half a pinky (awesome). It was the first time I did x, and I thought doing it while tripping must be great. I didnt feel anything for about 40 minutes. At that time, I went upstairs to find out the rest of my friends were laying on the floor, in a chill out bliss. I sat with them but felt a little uncomfortable, so I went back downstairs to sit in an armchair. Morg sat in front of me and asked do you feel it?. I replied I didnt, because I hadnt felt anything acid hadnt made me feel before. I started to feel anxious, I smoked a joint and relaxed.\r\n",
       "\n",
       " Morg repeatedly touched my knee and said do you feel this now?. When he was doing it, I didnt feel anything unusual, but upon removing his fingers from my knee I felt a direct connection with him, and a growing feeling of bliss. I started to play with the wind, because it felt incredibly good. One thing about xtc, it can make you extremely talkative and that can be all in your trip. You may experience nothing, but if you stop talking youll realise how high you are.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He suggested me to stop talking for a while, but when I did it, I tried to talk to him mentally. I was very surprised to find out I could, and everytime I did it felt like energy flowing throught the spine and giving me extreme pleasure. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Later on, he and my friends decided to drop another 1/2, to which I couldnt agree because I had no money and no pills left. Morg sat next to me and said I couldnt take more x without you, youve been my trip partner and I need you to go up with me. He gave me a full hit, and I took half of it because it was my first time and I was afraid I could OD. I didnt notice much difference, except for a couple of rushes where I couldnt stop trancing with pleasure. One hour later, we decided to drop the rest of it. Thats where I became demented.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The acid trip was unnoticeable at that time, but the connection with Morg was growing and it didnt seem to stop. As of then, I could see in his eyes what he was thinking, and we could easily communicate telepathically. I decided to let go of everything and enhance the trip. I mixed some more minutes, and left a mixed Oakenfold CD playing. I went outside to find out I was alone, but my friends were about 50 meters from the house. I walked up to them, and as I appeared we all hugged together, it was a fivefold hug. I felt intense pleasure, almost orgasmic, and found out that place, by the woods, was an energy spot.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I walked up to the house, and Morg ran up to me and yelled I cant believe how hard Im tripping! Dude, Im still tripping, this is unbelievable! As he said that, I felt all the acid multiply its effect exponentially, to the point of extreme delirium. And that happened in about 20 seconds, an incredible rush. I was hit so hard I immediately began to hallucinate... 11 hours after dropping such a small amount of lsd. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "But the weirdest part of the story, is that Morg and I fusionned into a Perfect Unity, to the point of hallucinating exactly the same things at the same time. It was a collective trip, something unbelievable. We first saw a hole in a cloud, like a black hole, the cloud sucking itself inside, but coming out from the other side, like an organic structure, it had a cycle. The black hole slowly evolved into two perfect Niagara cascades, one in front of the other. It was so detailed I could see the trees around it, the waterfalls, the evaporation, the rocks, everything in full colour. We were screaming in ecstasy because those waterfalls were intensely beautiful.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "All of a sudden, ALL the sky split in two, with a tidal wave effect Moses-like- when he spreads the oceans in the bible. This happened with a rain of energy, I could feel drops of energy going inside me, it felt incredibly good. When the show ended, I looked at Morg and shouted DID YOU SEE AND FEEL AND HEAR THAT???? to which he looked overwhelmed at me: dude, dont tell me you just saw a blackhole which morphed into two niagaras and the skysplit and the rain!!!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were so shocked by that we just hugged intensely. That hug felt incredibly great, totally blissful. Thats where we realised we were going in a sort of a cycle. We had a loop: 1. we went out the house with The Joint (it was sort of sacred, dont ask me why). 2. we sat on a bench, smoked one or two hits, talked for a minute or two. 3. we had an intense hallucination. 4. we went to the energy-point where we had all hugged together. 5. we hugged intensely and had an illumination, kind of an answer to the trip. 6. we went back inside the house, and upon entering it, the vibes of the music and our friends rushing, we would rush all the way up and rush them all up as well. 7. we talked to them about our trip and had a good laugh.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That loop, we did it at least 20 times uninterruptedly, each time hallucinating stronger and stronger. Once we saw a huge metallic sphere, with red crossed bars and airplanes, YES, AIRPLANES, inside, outside and everywere. I swear we saw exactly the same thing, and I felt Morg see the same thing.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We came up with a theory: rushes come in loops. Therefore, our loops must be the same frequency and hence in phase. Thats why we had so much energy, our trip was in fact a multiplied trip from his and mine. But the people inside the house had rushes in cycles that didnt match, so there was kind of a permanent high ambient inside the house, due also to the dreamtrance that was playing. The loop we did together was a representation of the cycle of our rushes, so thats why we always hallucinated at the same bench and felt everything identical.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I once got connected with the Moon. Everything seemed to produce its own vibes, and I could lowen or highen my frequency to be in phase with them. I got connected with the trees, the rocks, the bushes, the people, Morg intensely, and as I look up to the sky, I saw the most perfect Moon I ever saw. It wasnt full, but the details were so subtle I immediately reached up to it. I felt it try to reach me, and I saw MY HAND MORPHING INTO THE MOON, which had by the time the size of half my visual field.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Morg was feeling the energy flowing intensely as well.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It was unbelievable. A sort of Love where only the spiritual is important, physical is insignificant. A direct connection, a perfect Unity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The trip only seemed to keep on multiplicate its amplitude, we were having an extreme fantastic delirium, supernatural demency, ecstatic and peaceful bliss, orgasmic interpretation of all signals, catapulted creativity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in a different world. When the sun finally started to rise, I felt weeks had gone through, as if my trip had lasted about 45 days. One side of the sky was dark, the other one was light. This made us very confused, and we assumed it was about 5:30 P.M!! but instead of going down, the sun was going up! We were laughing hysterically when we saw a huge purple locomotive going thru the sky with sounds, having morphed from a hand that was spreading like a flower. When it reached the center of the sky, it morphed into a seed. I said look, its going to grow and it did! A beautiful shining deep green tree sprouted from the seed, and slowly began to expand, to give birth to a smaller, more yellow-ish tree. We assumed it was the big trees son.\r\n",
       "\n",

       "Last saturday I met up with some friends and we decided to go party in the mountains of Costa Rica. We went up there, about 32 km away from the city, a perfect party place. It was about 2:00 pm, and we were all happy.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We set up the DJing equipment and immediately I came up with the idea of seeking shrooms since there are cows in the lawn. We didnt find any, as the excessive rain let little sun set the appropriate temperature for them to grow.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Frustrated as we were, we decided to drop some acid and party on. We did, and I dropped ½ a hit. I began DJing, mixing some stomping goa to warm us up. I did excellent mixes, by the way. A friend I met that day came up to me with some pills, Nootropil (Piracetam), said to have a powerful enhancement on psychotropic drugs such as acid. It is said to connect both brain hemispheres, thus multiplicating the visuals effects. He said that hallucinations are tens of times more intense, more vivid, and the rush of creativity is catapulted. One can experience a trip that will change ones life, as I did. I dropped 3 orange pills (Nootropil), hoping I would have a good trip. That friend told me they were actually great for the brain, it is given to Alzheimers so they can have mind clarity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "As I began to mix the stompiest goa I have, the effects kicked in. It was a good trip, the good vibes seemed to come from everywhere. I met a guy, and within two or three looks on the eye, I knew we would have a great trip together. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We seemed to focus on the same details of the trip, laughing at exactly the same things. Explosive laughter, which creates a chain reaction, you know? Sometimes I would try to explain something I thought or vice versa, and by saying 4 or 5 words he would perfectly understand. Lets say, I thought the sound of a really quiet mouse in the house was coming from under the ground, I would say something quite broken- such as did you hear that? and before I could finish he would come up with something like its an underground rabbit thats trying to run away from your mouse, and just because you heard it, doesnt mean its really there, cause maybe were just in a weird trip, and this would mean we need to go under the ground, because I feel some vibes are in there. Lets seek that mouse... wait a minute",
       ". And there we exploded in acid laughter. Everytime he said something, he made more sense, and vice-versa. Lets say his names Morg. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Hours later, we had discovered we were extremely attached to each other, and we were acting as One. At night, we decided to drop some xtc. I dropped half a pinky (awesome). It was the first time I did x, and I thought doing it while tripping must be great. I didnt feel anything for about 40 minutes. At that time, I went upstairs to find out the rest of my friends were laying on the floor, in a chill out bliss. I sat with them but felt a little uncomfortable, so I went back downstairs to sit in an armchair. Morg sat in front of me and asked do you feel it?. I replied I didnt, because I hadnt felt anything acid hadnt made me feel before. I started to feel anxious, I smoked a joint and relaxed.\r\n",
       "\n",
       " Morg repeatedly touched my knee and said do you feel this now?. When he was doing it, I didnt feel anything unusual, but upon removing his fingers from my knee I felt a direct connection with him, and a growing feeling of bliss. I started to play with the wind, because it felt incredibly good. One thing about xtc, it can make you extremely talkative and that can be all in your trip. You may experience nothing, but if you stop talking youll realise how high you are.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "He suggested me to stop talking for a while, but when I did it, I tried to talk to him mentally. I was very surprised to find out I could, and everytime I did it felt like energy flowing throught the spine and giving me extreme pleasure. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "Later on, he and my friends decided to drop another 1/2, to which I couldnt agree because I had no money and no pills left. Morg sat next to me and said I couldnt take more x without you, youve been my trip partner and I need you to go up with me. He gave me a full hit, and I took half of it because it was my first time and I was afraid I could OD. I didnt notice much difference, except for a couple of rushes where I couldnt stop trancing with pleasure. One hour later, we decided to drop the rest of it. Thats where I became demented.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The acid trip was unnoticeable at that time, but the connection with Morg was growing and it didnt seem to stop. As of then, I could see in his eyes what he was thinking, and we could easily communicate telepathically. I decided to let go of everything and enhance the trip. I mixed some more minutes, and left a mixed Oakenfold CD playing. I went outside to find out I was alone, but my friends were about 50 meters from the house. I walked up to them, and as I appeared we all hugged together, it was a fivefold hug. I felt intense pleasure, almost orgasmic, and found out that place, by the woods, was an energy spot.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I walked up to the house, and Morg ran up to me and yelled I cant believe how hard Im tripping! Dude, Im still tripping, this is unbelievable! As he said that, I felt all the acid multiply its effect exponentially, to the point of extreme delirium. And that happened in about 20 seconds, an incredible rush. I was hit so hard I immediately began to hallucinate... 11 hours after dropping such a small amount of lsd. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "But the weirdest part of the story, is that Morg and I fusionned into a Perfect Unity, to the point of hallucinating exactly the same things at the same time. It was a collective trip, something unbelievable. We first saw a hole in a cloud, like a black hole, the cloud sucking itself inside, but coming out from the other side, like an organic structure, it had a cycle. The black hole slowly evolved into two perfect Niagara cascades, one in front of the other. It was so detailed I could see the trees around it, the waterfalls, the evaporation, the rocks, everything in full colour. We were screaming in ecstasy because those waterfalls were intensely beautiful.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "All of a sudden, ALL the sky split in two, with a tidal wave effect Moses-like- when he spreads the oceans in the bible. This happened with a rain of energy, I could feel drops of energy going inside me, it felt incredibly good. When the show ended, I looked at Morg and shouted DID YOU SEE AND FEEL AND HEAR THAT???? to which he looked overwhelmed at me: dude, dont tell me you just saw a blackhole which morphed into two niagaras and the skysplit and the rain!!!\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were so shocked by that we just hugged intensely. That hug felt incredibly great, totally blissful. Thats where we realised we were going in a sort of a cycle. We had a loop: 1. we went out the house with The Joint (it was sort of sacred, dont ask me why). 2. we sat on a bench, smoked one or two hits, talked for a minute or two. 3. we had an intense hallucination. 4. we went to the energy-point where we had all hugged together. 5. we hugged intensely and had an illumination, kind of an answer to the trip. 6. we went back inside the house, and upon entering it, the vibes of the music and our friends rushing, we would rush all the way up and rush them all up as well. 7. we talked to them about our trip and had a good laugh.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "That loop, we did it at least 20 times uninterruptedly, each time hallucinating stronger and stronger. Once we saw a huge metallic sphere, with red crossed bars and airplanes, YES, AIRPLANES, inside, outside and everywere. I swear we saw exactly the same thing, and I felt Morg see the same thing.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We came up with a theory: rushes come in loops. Therefore, our loops must be the same frequency and hence in phase. Thats why we had so much energy, our trip was in fact a multiplied trip from his and mine. But the people inside the house had rushes in cycles that didnt match, so there was kind of a permanent high ambient inside the house, due also to the dreamtrance that was playing. The loop we did together was a representation of the cycle of our rushes, so thats why we always hallucinated at the same bench and felt everything identical.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I once got connected with the Moon. Everything seemed to produce its own vibes, and I could lowen or highen my frequency to be in phase with them. I got connected with the trees, the rocks, the bushes, the people, Morg intensely, and as I look up to the sky, I saw the most perfect Moon I ever saw. It wasnt full, but the details were so subtle I immediately reached up to it. I felt it try to reach me, and I saw MY HAND MORPHING INTO THE MOON, which had by the time the size of half my visual field.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Morg was feeling the energy flowing intensely as well.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It was unbelievable. A sort of Love where only the spiritual is important, physical is insignificant. A direct connection, a perfect Unity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The trip only seemed to keep on multiplicate its amplitude, we were having an extreme fantastic delirium, supernatural demency, ecstatic and peaceful bliss, orgasmic interpretation of all signals, catapulted creativity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "We were in a different world. When the sun finally started to rise, I felt weeks had gone through, as if my trip had lasted about 45 days. One side of the sky was dark, the other one was light. This made us very confused, and we assumed it was about 5:30 P.M!! but instead of going down, the sun was going up! We were laughing hysterically when we saw a huge purple locomotive going thru the sky with sounds, having morphed from a hand that was spreading like a flower. When it reached the center of the sky, it morphed into a seed. I said look, its going to grow and it did! A beautiful shining deep green tree sprouted from the seed, and slowly began to expand, to give birth to a smaller, more yellow-ish tree. We assumed it was the big trees son.\r\n",

We were crying rivers and it was great. At about 32 hours (4 in the morning) we were coming down from the weed and shroom crumbs, and went to bed. \r\n",

       "Then I realized that I could hear some Hard Trance coming from somewhere.  I stopped to listen for a second.  The beat was amazing; I had never heard this beat before.  This beat seemed a step ahead of anything I had ever heard.  It was mind blowing.  I tried to remember the name of this track, or where I had heard it before, but I couldn&amp;#39;t place it.  It was new.  I had never heard it before.\r\n",

I was in some kind of labyrinth.\r\n",

       "Then I looked to the ground near my feet.  A small colored pill on the floor had caught my eye.  I picked it up; it was a small bright green pill with the letters CU engraved into it.  I realized what I had found; it was a legendary green CU ecstasy!  Instinctively I shoved it into my mouth.  I stood up and continued on my way. Just a few feet ahead of me I could see another one.  I ran over to it, picked it up, and had a good look at it.  This time it was a white pill with a stamp of a white smiley face on it.  I ingested it just as quickly as the last.  Then again!  Another pill, just a few feet ahead of this one.  I ran over to it.  This one was a brown butterfly.  Once again, without any hesitation I swallowed it.  The pills continued on, like a trail.  Apparently it was a deliberate trail.  I continued to follow them, eating each one as I picked them up.  There were all kinds of colors and pictures on them, a rainbow of serotonin candy.  I willingly followed the trail through the labyrinth.  It led me down a few hallways, and eventually to a ladder.  I climbed over the ladder.  As I reached over the last few rings of the ladder, I could see a river on this level of the labyrinth.\r\n",

       "As I stood up the feeling of the evil presence grew more intense in my solar plexus.  It was closer now.  I continued following the trail of pills again.  Then suddenly I heard a loud beeping sound.  My alarm clock awakened me from slumber.  I opened my eyes and slowly came to my senses.  The first thing that came to mind was the beat that I had heard in my dream.  In my dream I had heard the beat with perfect clarity, almost as if I had really heard it.  The beat was burnt into my brain.  I looked over at the alarm clock.  It was three-thirty in the afternoon.  Time to get ready for work.  After my morning joint, I prepared my body for meditation with some yoga.  Then I prepared my mind for mediation with my favorite Zen meditation...\r\n",

I loved using city transit, because it gave me time everyday for some reading.  But today I decided not to bring a book.  I gazed out the window at the beautiful cityscape beneath the loving light of the sun.  It was Saturday, my favorite day of the week.  The train gracefully slowed into the next station.

I reached the building where I worked, a classy restaurant on the first floor of a business skyscraper in the city center.  I entered the lobby, security cameras where hanging in every corner.  I walked by the hall of chrome elevators and entered the restaurant through the back.  I changed into my white uniform, put on my chef&amp;#39;s hat, and made my way to the line.\r\n",

The beat was still in my mind with perfect clarity, as if I was still hearing it at that very moment.  The shift went swiftly, as it always did.  I loved being a cook.  My nights were filled with steaks, shrimp Hunan&amp;#39;s, green curry, and a whole assortment of exotic and exquisite foods.  Exquisite girls also filled my night.  I would pass my free moments flirting, and talking with the beautiful servers.  I worked the closing shift six nights a week.  I loved the night shift, I guess because I sleep till late every afternoon everyday I can, and also because I had out grown, or should I say, evolved out of the bars.

       "When we got home I went straight for my weed.  After I got my chronic fix I headed to the kitchen, I was hungry.  We had just moved into our new house.  It cost us everything we had just to get in the door, well with last and first month&amp;#39;s rent.  It also didn&amp;#39;t help that cooks don&amp;#39;t make much more than minimum wage.

All that was in there was a loaf of bread, and a jar of peanut butter.  &amp;#39;Peanut butter toast it is...&amp;#39; I mumbled.  I grabbed a few slices of bread and placed them on our toaster.  &amp;#39;Ah, the irony of life, you&amp;#39;re always there for me, sometimes you&amp;#39;re the only one I know I can depend on.&amp;#39; I thought to myself and had to laugh for a minute. \r\n",

       "You see when we moved out of our apartment, the last toaster belonged to our other roommate who didn&amp;#39;t move with us, and since we didn&amp;#39;t even have money at the moment for food, we didn&amp;#39;t have money for a toaster yet.  So our toaster was a metal coat hanger bent in half and placed on the stove element, so it held the bread just over the element.  I stood there with a smile on my face, watching my toast cook thinking about all the delicious foods I cook all night, night after night for the wealthy people.  Ninety percent of the menu I hadn&amp;#39;t even tried before, I couldn&amp;#39;t afford the cost of these extravagant foods.  So I get to wear my chef&amp;#39;s uniform, and prepare foods like sushi, swordfish, salmon linguini, and chicken Hunan&amp;#39;s, then after work I get to go home and make peanut butter toast on a coat hanger for myself. I smiled again, ate my toast and headed for the shower.\r\n",

I also had a pair for everyday wear.  I must be somewhere near my tenth pair of the same shoes in a row.  Then I busted out my shoe shampoo, my dancing shoes had to be spotless.  Next it was my white dancing pants.  After that I threw on a black tight T-shirt, over that a black nylon skintight long sleeve shirt.  My last layer was my huge baggy solid black hooded sweater.  I loved wearing it, it felt like a Jedi cloak, or I liked to pretend it was anyway.  Then my final article, my priceless, spotless, solid white baseball hat. \r\n",

I grabbed my backpack, through my fire and glowsticking chains in, my flags, my white cotton liquid gloves, my digital camera, my video camera, and a towel.

We both ingest about three or four grams.  Mike ate about one or two grams, then we headed into the Warehouse.  There was a long line to get in.  It looked like it was about an hour wait to get in.  It was all good though, we&amp;#39;re VIP.  We walked to the VIP line and after a quick search by the doorman and paying our guest fee we were in.\r\n",

       "As I walked in the loving lasers and moving electronic beats hit me.  It felt like the warm sun on my spirit.  I headed over to a corner and started doing some stretching.  Anthem was up on the decks and the music was still relatively slow, he was just warming it up.  I found a corner in the back and started to warm up my body, dancing lightly, like I always did at the beginning of the night.\r\n",

       "I continued to dance lightly, but mostly I was waiting for my shrooms to hit me.  After about forty-five minutes the high completely swarmed my mind, it was almost too much.  Just the way I like it.  Now I am extremely good at dancing, I wouldn&amp;#39;t settle for anything less.  I don&amp;#39;t know why, but when my mind is tripped out, completely ripped, and I&amp;#39;m hallucinating to the point where I don&amp;#39;t have any grip on reality, my dancing becomes out of this world, unbelievable.  I don&amp;#39;t know exactly why, but I guess it opens my mind, makes me think of things and ways I&amp;#39;ve never thought of.  When I go raving, I get myself so high that I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s not.  I can&amp;#39;t have a conversation with someone because I would be talking gibberish, and I have to avoid everyone.  But the reason I do this is because after I stumble around and somehow find my way to the dance floor, my dancing goes intergalactic.  I remember reading somewhere that the ancients used to call magic mushrooms, &amp;#39;the flowers of the Gods&amp;#39;.\r\n",

Instead of natural curves and shapes, everything took on unnatural, digital-like shapes.  It was like a low-quality video clip on your computer.  If my vision was compared to a computer monitor resolution, then when I was sober I would see with perfect clarity, my resolution would be 3200 x 2400, but when I was tripped out on LSD or mushrooms, my resolution was like 320 x 240.  If you were standing in front of me your body was composed of about 30 pixels, or 30 large differently shaded squares.  I loved it.  I was half man, half-machine.  Sometimes it scared me, it felt so good to be in this state, to become one with technology, but at the same time something inside told me it was wrong.  But I couldn&amp;#39;t stop; it felt too good, even if I did have doubts. \r\n",

I had not seen or heard him yet.  Immediately he began to rock the house like I had never seen.  I stood there for about a half an hour in awe as he played track after track, taking everyone high and higher.  The vibrations and energy of everyone grew to a level I had never experience before.

I could feel the vibrations from the powerful speakers rattle my insides.  I sat alone, perched upon a stage next to the dance floor.  I was slouched over staring down at the floor watching the little spots of light glide gracefully across the floor.  They had been cast upon the floor by the light and laser machines suspended above me.  The spots would all move in different directions from each other for a few moments, then they&amp;#39;d all start to move in the same direction in total unity.  That was the part I liked.  Unity is one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced.  I continued to sit there, deep in thought.  \r\n",

One by one, each person arrived onto the same wavelength.  Until everyone was riding the same wavelength.  The energy here in this world was so loving, so positive.  Perfect synchrony.  Dolby chased every last bit of chaos from the real world out of the Warehouse.  Chaos was cast out.  Chaos did not exist here, it couldn&amp;#39;t exist in here.\r\n",

       "I sat quietly waiting for the right track to pick me up and place me on the dance floor.  The Warehouse began to travel further and further away from the chaotic reality we lived in, until we had escaped the material world.  We had broken free.  I closed my eyes, and began to collect some energy.  I inhaled through my nose, held for a second, and exhaled through my mouth.  I continued the meditative breathing, imagining in my mind light colored positive energy entering as I inhaled, and negative dark colored energy leaving as I exhaled.  With each breath I envisioned my energy growing larger and larger with each breath, like a giant cloud of energy all around my body, growing larger with each breath, until my energy cloud engulfed the entire Warehouse.  I began to let go and surrender.  The energy began to send a familiar feeling that pulsated throughout my body.  It began in my head then moved out to the ends of my arms and legs.  It felt like a cool tingling sensation that was running through my insides.  As I collected a surplus of positive energy, my heart and my spirit began to throttle.  Vibrating faster and stronger with each electronic pulse, my spirit began to pull my body to the floor, but not yet.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Again and again, track after track, just when you thought there was no way it could get any better, no way it could get any more beautiful, anymore perfect, Dolby would blow your mind up and drop a track that you&amp;#39;ve never heard, a track somehow better than the last, just at the perfect moment.  The Massive erupted in a fury of euphoric screams.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The almost magnetic-like pull emanating from the floor grew stronger and more powerful with every revolutionary beat.  Thump, thump, thump.  Then all of a sudden it happened.  Dolby flicked that switch and dropped the next track.  My spirit went into total shock. I was paralyzed.  The track was unbelievable, so revolutionary, and so perfectly timed, and so synchronous that I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was hearing.  It was the beat from my dream!  I had not heard this track until now.  I was completely scared yet my mind was on a level that I knew would change me for the rest of my life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It is time.  I opened my eyes I found myself in the middle of the front stage, in front of Dolby and the DJ booth.  Yet I could not remember standing up and walking here, it was almost as if I had just appeared there with no physical movement.  I surrendered, my limbs and body began to release and pour out my unimaginable inspiration.  I let go of my ego.  This is not me, I am one with everything, the music, the earth, the people.   I began living in the moment, no past, no future, only now.  I could feel the energy of the other dancers, the music, and the Earth.  I just allowed the energy to pass through me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Here it comes.  The revolutionary music power pierced through the speakers and hit me, in that millisecond I transformed it into untainted pure rhythm.  My moves were inhuman, out of this world.  With cold machine-like precision my inspiration commanded everyone&amp;#39;s eyes, everyone&amp;#39;s energy, everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.  They could not believe what they were seeing, it was changing them, changing the way they thought and lived.  I could hear people start screaming and cheering for me in pure euphoria.  I could not believe it.  It began to ease everyone&amp;#39;s hearts, they became paralyzed, their eyes fixated upon me.  Their spirits began feeding and charging themselves from my inspiration.  It became our inspiration.  The beads of sweat ran down my face and chest.  I was breathing heavily, trying to catch my breath.  One by one, each dancer stopped, either by exhaustion, or pure bewilderment.  Until everyone was stopped, watching me in amazement.  I could feel each spirit, each individual soul.  The energy passing through me was unfathomable.  It felt like a waterfall of gushing pure, positive, loving energy was running though my veins.  The moment lasted an eternity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Then it happened.  I began to hear, and receive everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.  I could hear two hundred different voices in my head.  Everyone was pleading for me not to stop.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;Keep going!&amp;#39; one voice whispered.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;No, don&amp;#39;t stop,&amp;#39; another voice asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Next my dance came to its unimaginable meta-physical climax.  The beat disappeared.  Just the beautiful sound of the all-loving electronic siren soothing and easing our hearts.  I turned around, and dropped to my knees.  The sweat dripping from my body, my lungs desperately tried to catch my breath.  I had become like a sun, the energy-giving center upon which everyone&amp;#39;s destinies and lives revolved.  I had become the vision on my youth.  Men and women hung upon my inspiration, our inspiration, and reshaped their characters.  From now on I would dance and lives would be changed. \r\n",

       "Something was different now.  Something had happened.  I felt like a leader of some sort.  Like we were no longer individuals, but like we were one mean, lean, raving machine.  We were all different parts of something bigger than us, bigger than this world, this reality, and at the center of it all was me, like a heart pumping pure loving energy to everyone.  I looked at all the people, everyone looked back at me in complete awe, and I returned the same look of awe back.  Nobody could believe let alone comprehend what had just happened.  \r\n",

       "We had all been awakened to a new reality, to a New World.  I had showed them my light, our light.  It felt like they looked to me as if I was some sort of light leading them from the darkness.  Yet no words had past through our mouths.  Not even a nod of a head.  Yet I said it, and they heard it. I walked away, and pulled the hood of my Jedi cloak on again to shroud my face in shadows.  I left my people in their and my new awakened state.  I walked out the door.  It felt like I was watching a movie now, not like I was in a movie anymore.  I had never felt this refreshed, this much love, this kind of energy ever before in my life.  It felt like I had just run through a rainforest. This one moment changed me forever.\r\n",

One of them looked at me and just said,\r\n",

As I looked over at the Warehouse one by one, almost everyone filed out of the Warehouse to see this sunrise.  Everyone was running in to get his or her friends.  It was so beautiful that you didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to miss it.  I ran in and got Duane and brought him out, we sat in the vehicle and just watched the sunrise in paralyzed by its beauty for about twenty minutes.  Then we decided to go back in listen to rest of Dolby&amp;#39;s set.\r\n",

It felt like, no I knew, I was the one who was going to lead this revolution.  We were going to change the world, regenerate it, and this revolution began in that everlasting moment.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;You&amp;#39;re a fucking crazy dancer! You dance like the wind!&amp;#39; he exclaimed.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Thanks.  You know that&amp;#39;s funny you said that.  My native name is &amp;#39;Dances Like the Wind&amp;#39; &amp;#39; I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Really?&amp;#39; He said, looking very surprised.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;No, I&amp;#39;m just playing, bro.&amp;#39; I said laughing.  He laughed back and smiled.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;My name is Miles,&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Oh I&amp;#39;m Jason,&amp;#39; he replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Nice to meet you bro.  Sit down for a bit, I know there&amp;#39;s something&amp;#39;s you need to hear,&amp;#39; I said.  He sat down on the stool next to me.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;How do I learn how to dance?  I want to learn so bad.&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "I thought to myself, &amp;#39;when the student is ready, the teacher appears&amp;#39;, then said &amp;#39;I can tell you about the secrets I have learned if you&amp;#39;d like.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Really? You&amp;#39;d do that?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Of course, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m here for.&amp;#39; I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;First, let me tell you how I approach my dancing first.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Sure.&amp;#39; He replied, with an eager look on face.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;A lot of people think that the reason I dance is to be the best, or look the best.  They feel that my dancing is all about me.  I can see it in their eyes.  But it&amp;#39;s not like that.  My dancing is for you, for everybody else here.&amp;#39; I said.  He continued to listen, looking very interested.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What I try to do everyday is to show people what is possible, I want to inspire people, to inspire them so much that they have no choice but to join in.  Once they start dancing, I hope they will experience the freedom, the energy, and spirituality, I have found in the music and dancing.  It is the most spiritual thing I have ever experienced, and I want to share that with every single person I can.  My dancing is about liberating other people&amp;#39;s spirits, so they transcend the material world and enter a more spiritual world.  I try lead people away from the darkness.  I hope I have inspired you somehow.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;You have!&amp;#39; He replied. &amp;#39;I do, I do want to dance, but I&amp;#39;m too scared to go out on the dance floor, I&amp;#39;m afraid of how, I&amp;#39;ll look.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I remember when I first started raving, I was in the same position.  I was too scared to go out, I was too worried that I&amp;#39;d look like an idiot.  For the first three months of raving, I didn&amp;#39;t even think about stepping on the dance floor.  But then one night, I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened, but I just found myself on the dance floor, and I was dancing!  It was awesome.  So what I tell everyone, who tells me that they don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable about going on the dance floor is; to just keep coming out, keep coming to the raves and just sit and watch the other dancers, and listen to the music, and eventually one night you&amp;#39;ll come out and out of nowhere you&amp;#39;ll find yourself on the dance floor.  You&amp;#39;ll be dancing and you&amp;#39;ll have no idea how it happened.  It will just happen.  Don&amp;#39;t push it, just keep coming out, and when you&amp;#39;re ready you&amp;#39;ll find yourself doing it, not knowing how it happened.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Thanks, for the advice, really thanks,&amp;#39; he said.  &amp;#39;Anytime bro, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m here for.&amp;#39; I replied. &amp;#39;Once you begin dancing, whenever that happens, remember don&amp;#39;t push it, just start watching the other dancers, and how they move their bodies.  That&amp;#39;s how I learned my first few moves, was I copied them from other people.  But try not to copy other people, you will get no respect that way, just try to use their moves as a guide to find your style.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;My style?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah, before I tell you about your style, I first have to explain to you what dancing is.&amp;#39; I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay&amp;#39; he said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Music is a power.  One of the strongest powers on Earth, in fact it is so strong that in ancient times, the church controlled music, you were only allowed to make it for and in church.  So now you know music is a power, I&amp;#39;ll tell you how to utilize that power.  What dancing is is the pure act of metamorphosis.  The DJ is sending out this music power, and the instant that it hits you, you transform this music power as best as you can into physical power.  As you get better and better at dancing, you become better at instantly transforming that music energy into a physical energy.  Think of it like painting a picture.  This relates to your style as I said earlier.  If everyone were to paint a picture, no picture would be the same.  We are all individual&amp;#39;s and we would all have different expressions.  Dancing is obviously a form of expression, a physical one.  So after awhile of dancing, your dance will evolve into your own individual expression, you&amp;#39;ll have your own style.  Look at all these people dancing here, they all have their own individual styles, they are all expressing their present emotions in their own individual way.&amp;#39; I said.  He looked at few of the dancers and looked back at me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I see what you&amp;#39;re saying; it&amp;#39;s all making sense to me.  It all sounds so right.  Where do you learn this stuff?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;The Underground&amp;#39; I replied smiling.  We sat there for a few moments.  Then he asked,\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Did you do anything tonight?  I mean did you do any drugs.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah.  I did some Acid.&amp;#39; I replied.  I could tell this completely stunned him.  He moved his body back in amazement.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What?  Acid?&amp;#39;  He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well it&amp;#39;s the only drug that still makes me a better dancer.  I owe all my dancing to drugs.&amp;#39;  I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;How can you handle it, and keep yourself in public?  I mean I&amp;#39;ve tried it a few times when I was younger, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be public while on it.&amp;#39;  He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well, first off, what most ravers today don&amp;#39;t know, is that, Acid was all ravers did back in the day, there was no Ecstasy.  Ecstasy only began to become very popular in the earlier nineties.  I know what you&amp;#39;re saying though about handling it.  Ninety-nine percent of the population doesn&amp;#39;t posses the ability to channel LSD positively, for ninety-nine out of one hundred people; they can only channel the LSD negatively, and have bad experiences.  But what I tell people is that when you are able to channel LSD positively, the level it takes your mind to it is unbelievable.  When I am dancing on Acid, I have control of every little muscle, every tendon, and every part of my body, parts I didn&amp;#39;t even know I had.  It&amp;#39;s wild.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes when I do a spin, which is probably a quarter of a second, it will go in slow motion, and the spin will last for three seconds.  Shrooms are good too, but they make me tired and don&amp;#39;t give me any energy.  LSD is such a powerful psychedelic that it is also like a super amphetamine.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Wow.&amp;#39; he replied, sitting there not knowing what to say.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong though, when I first started raving it was all Ecstasy.  I ate it like it was going out of style.  I owe all my whole dancing career to Ecstasy.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do you mean?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well that&amp;#39;s another key to dancing, well for me anyhow.  Ecstasy opened the door for me.  It showed me what was possible.  In the beginning it gave me the courage and confidence to start dancing.  I was very insecure before.  But what Ecstasy does, is it removes all your fears.  Your fear of looking stupid, your fear of saying something stupid.  When that happens, all that is left is the real you.  You aren&amp;#39;t afraid of being yourself, of what other people think.  You stop fronting or stop wearing a mask.  But in my experiences, Ecstasy can only take you so far.  My dancing got to a point where I was performing extraordinary moves that required all of my balance.  Ecstasy impairs your balance, so it was holding me back at that point.  So I experimented with shrooms and LSD, and I found that the Acid took me to levels I never thought were possible.  But don&amp;#39;t forget without the Ecstasy I would have never walked through that door.&amp;#39; I replied.  He was hanging on to my every word.  I could tell that he could of sat there all night and listened to me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll tell you what bro, keep coming out every weekend.  I&amp;#39;ll be here every weekend too, it&amp;#39;s my weekly ritual, and when I think you are ready for the next secret, I&amp;#39;ll share it with you.  It would be too much for you to try to absorb everything in one sitting.  I think you&amp;#39;ve got a lot to think about already, cause I&amp;#39;m going to get out there and do some dancing.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Sure.  Thanks for sharing that with me, really thanks, it meant a lot.&amp;#39; he replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Anytime bro, really.  I mean it.  But before I go, I want to do something.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay,&amp;#39; he replied.  I reached into my backpack and pulled out my spray bottle.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay stand up,&amp;#39; I said.  He stood up.  &amp;#39;Let me explain what I&amp;#39;m going to do to you.  It was done to me when I first started raving, and I didn&amp;#39;t understand it and it&amp;#39;s significance for a few years.&amp;#39;  I sprayed his forehead with water. &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s like being baptized.  Water represents life.  I&amp;#39;m not trying to make fun of Christianity or anything.  There&amp;#39;s tremendous power in symbolism.  This means that you belong to a tribe now.&amp;#39; I said, and smiled at him.  I could tell he sort of understood me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay.&amp;#39; he said.  I started to turn away and he held out his hand to shake my hand.  I was just about to say something and he realized this and instead made a fist.  I smiled and nodded my head and we hit fists. &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll talk to you later bro.&amp;#39;  I said.  &amp;#39;Alright, Miles&amp;#39; he replied.  He smiled and sat back down.  I made my way to the dance floor to do another set.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "________________________________________________ \n",

       "A few weeks later I was out at a rave, and again, I saw Jason.  There he was out there going off like a veteran raver.  It always makes me feel good to see that I was making a difference in someone&amp;#39;s dancing. I watched him for a bit. \r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Wow&amp;#39; I thought to myself.  He&amp;#39;s starting to get it.  He really impressed me.  He was really feeling the music.  Yet another young Jedi in training.  &amp;#39;The force is strong with him,&amp;#39; I though to myself, and laughed.  Then he saw me, and immediately he ran over.  We talked for a bit.  He seemed happy to see me again, and I was glad he was taking so good to raving.  I hoped it was positively affecting his life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Then we decided to go outside and burn some weed.  I twisted up a nice fatty.  While we were smoking it I said,\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I think your ready for some more secrets.&amp;#39; \r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m ready!  Come on Miles, tell me some more!&amp;#39; He exclaimed.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay.  The next few things are rather simple, and there really isn&amp;#39;t anything that deep or special to them.  Now you just simply have to apply discipline to your dancing.  You need to train your body.  Now, however much you chose to practice, and train, is up to you.  There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with only practicing when you are out raving on the weekends.  Raving isn&amp;#39;t a competition.  But I like to practice everyday, every morning, by practicing everyday, I won&amp;#39;t only take my level of dancing up, but I&amp;#39;ll take the level of everyone who watches me and dances with me up.  So however much you decide to practice is entirely up to you, but the more you practice, the faster your dance will evolve.&amp;#39; I said.  He continued to sit there listening.  &amp;#39;Now I&amp;#39;m the kind of person, where I have to be the best at everything I do, if I&amp;#39;m not, then I will practice until I am.  But that&amp;#39;s just me, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s very natural though, because I use to practice so much, that I would lose toenails.  My toenails would turn blue and fall off. I&amp;#39;ve lost about ten of them in my life.  I&amp;#39;ve also had two stress fractures, in my metatarsals in my left foot.  So I was a little extreme.  I&amp;#39;m not expecting this from you, or from anybody for that matter, it&amp;#39;s just a work ethic I&amp;#39;ve developed from my basketball playing days, and from growing up watching and listening to my hero Michael Jordan all my life.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;But how do I know what to do when I practice?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well what I did was study video of the best.  The one person I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve studied the most in my life would have to be Michael Jackson.  I downloaded as many video clips as I could find of Michael Jackson on the Internet, and I would watch his clips over and over and over, for months on end.  When I saw a move I would watch it over and over and over, then go and practice and practice and practice, till I could do it.  But whom you watch obviously depends on what styles of dancing you&amp;#39;re trying to learn.  Like I still watch video clips of the masters everyday, I watch all styles; Freestyles, Breakdancing, Popping and Locking, Liquid, Flagging, Glowsticking, and Fire Dancing.  Remember the body cannot do what it cannot visualize first.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Visualize?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yes, that is the other technique I was going to share with you today.  Visualization is a technique used by athletes at the top of their sports.  Like Olympic powerlifters, or NBA basketball players.  You see everything in this world is created twice, the first creation is mentally, and then the second comes the physical creation.  You have to visualize your moves in your mind first, see yourself doing it in your mind.  Sometimes when I couldn&amp;#39;t perform a move I had been trying to do for months, I would sit down, close my eyes and for about five or ten minutes just try to picture myself doing it in my mind.  Then I would get up and try it, and a lot of time it would happen.  But if it doesn&amp;#39;t work, don&amp;#39;t get discouraged, I&amp;#39;ve had some moves take up three months before I actually pulled it off.  In fact two moves of the moves I&amp;#39;m currently working on I have been visualizing and practicing for over two years already but I still haven&amp;#39;t actually pulled them off yet.&amp;#39; I said. &amp;#39;Remember the body cannot do what the mind cannot visualize first.&amp;#39; He sat there nodding his head; I could tell by the way he was half squinting his eyes that he was thinking about everything I had just told him.  I continued on, &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t think anybody has said it better than Morpheus in the movie the Matrix; you&amp;#39;re better (faster) than this, don&amp;#39;t think you are, know you are.&amp;#39; I said.  We both smiled.  &amp;#39;You have to let it all go, fear, doubt, and disbelief ... free your mind.&amp;#39; I said again, obviously quoting Morpheus again.  I continued on jokingly, &amp;#39;But that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got those red pills for right? So did you take the red or the blue pill?&amp;#39; I asked him, smiling.  &amp;#39;The red one. &amp;#39; He said, laughing back. Then he promptly asked, &amp;#39;What about you Miles, did you take the red pill?&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;Actually I took two of them.&amp;#39; I said, followed by a big smile, we both had a good laugh.  We continued to talk for bit more about some other stuff.  Then we went and danced.  At the end of the night I told him when he&amp;#39;s ready, I&amp;#39;d teach him some more.\r\n",

       "Over the next four or five weekends I ran into Jason a few times, and we would talk, and I would show him some of my moves, and different styles.  I let him try my flags, and my glowsticking chains, to see how he handled them.  I also tried showing him some liquid, and taught him a few breakdancing moves.  Then one night I felt he was ready to learn the last few secrets I knew, and had experienced myself.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Alright young Jedi, I think you&amp;#39;re ready for some more.&amp;#39; I said, with a smile on my face.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m listening, Miles&amp;#39; Jason replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;One of the secrets I have today is just simply one word.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;One word?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah.  Surrender.  That one simple word made a world of difference in my level of dancing.  Before I used to try to dance, or try to dance better, and I would try harder and harder.  But the harder I tried the more difficult it became.  I was trying to force my dancing.  It won&amp;#39;t work like that.  You have to surrender to the music, you have to surrender to your dancing, surrender to the energy.  You have to live in the moment.  It&amp;#39;s almost as if you stop dancing, and instead you are sitting on the side, just watching yourself dance.  You become detached from the dance yet engaged in the dance.&amp;#39;  I replied.  Then I asked, &amp;#39;Do you grasp what I am saying?&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;Well, sort of.&amp;#39;  He replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t worry if you don&amp;#39;t understand it yet, you will.  With practice you will come to understand my teachings.&amp;#39;   He sat there I could tell his mind was slowly, yet surely metabolizing the insights I was feeding him.  &amp;#39;There was this one quote that I came across on the Internet one day, and I liked it.  I felt it encompassed a lot of what we live in one sentence.  It was; &amp;#39;Music is our scripture, dance is our practice, once united, we can&amp;#39;t be divided, feel the bass. PLUR&amp;#39;.  Now there was one final insight that I wanted to share with you tonight.  The level of mastery that you covet so much cannot be reached until you let go of your ego.  You have to get your ego out of it.  You have to realize that it isn&amp;#39;t you performing the moves.  It isn&amp;#39;t about being the best, or looking the best.  Your ego will only hold you back.  You have to just allow the energy to pass through you.  You have to almost say &amp;#39;this isn&amp;#39;t me, I&amp;#39;m just allowing the energy to pass through me&amp;#39;.  When you discard your ego, anything will be possible.  Now I have nothing more to teach you.  Your vision is a promise of what one day you will be.  The strength of your efforts will be the measure of your results.  You will become the vision of your youth one-day Jason.  Go, and dance, because if you didn&amp;#39;t come here to dance, then what the fuck did you come here for?!&amp;#39;\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;The same way I got through to you.  You were once lost, just as he is, and so was I at one time.&amp;#39; I said, then I continued.  &amp;#39;Our raving is the most spiritual thing in our lives right.  You know how we call the Warehouse our church right?  It&amp;#39;s our weekly ritual.  We couldn&amp;#39;t possibly think of living without raving right?  The music and the dancing have raised our state of consciousness.  It was here that we found ourselves.  It was here that we found peace, love, unity, and respect.  It was here that we found our people, our tribe.  Before you met me, before I found the Warehouse, or should I say the Warehouse found me.  I was a little punk thug drug dealer.  All I did was drink, have sex and sell and do drugs.  You told me that before the Warehouse all you did was steal, that you were a professional thief with your gang, and you stole to get drugs.  Well I sold drugs to get my drugs.  Today&amp;#39;s youth doesn&amp;#39;t listen to their elders.  All kids want to do is do drugs.  Drugs plague our generation.  But don&amp;#39;t you see that&amp;#39;s one of the whole keys to it all, bro.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What key?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What&amp;#39;s the only thing today&amp;#39;s youth want to do?&amp;#39; I asked him.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Like you said, drugs, and sex.&amp;#39; he replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yes, and everyone is trying to talk, to counsel, to guide these kids.  They are our future.  But they don&amp;#39;t listen.  Every year, it just gets worse and worse.  Many have given up hope.  They feel it&amp;#39;s too late.&amp;#39;  I said, then continued.  &amp;#39;But that&amp;#39;s the trick, that&amp;#39;s how they reached me, and that&amp;#39;s how I reached you.  Was through the drugs.  We give them this Ecstasy, and we say &amp;#39;Here take this!  It feels great doesn&amp;#39;t it?  Want some more?  Of course you do, here!&amp;#39;  It&amp;#39;s the only way we can reach them, through their drugs.  So then they start coming out every weekend to get high, and they love it.  But while they are here, while they are high, we show them what it&amp;#39;s all about. PEACE,LOVE,UNITY,RESPECT.  We show them the power of music.  We show them the power of dance.  We bring them into our world.  We change them.  Then when they are ready, after they start seeing that, we walk over and tell them something.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do we tell them?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;The same thing that was told to me, and the same thing that I told you.  That they are coming for the wrong reasons.  They are coming for the drugs, when they should be coming for the music, and dancing, for the unity.  When you tell them that, they realize it.  They think, &amp;#39;I am coming for the wrong reasons&amp;#39;.  But at that point the power of the music and dance, the power of the unity has affected them so deeply that they start coming for the right reasons.  But do you think if we tried to reach that kid normally, tried to teach him about spirituality, that he would of listened?  You think we would have had any opportunity to change him with out the drugs?  You think I could walk up to a group of high school kids on the street and try to teach them anything about spirituality?  They&amp;#39;d all laugh at me.  But one day that kid over there is going to be coming for the right reasons, sure he still might get high when he comes, but that won&amp;#39;t be the main reason he comes.  He&amp;#39;ll be coming for the music, and the dancing, and the unity.  One day he&amp;#39;ll be a true raver.&amp;#39;\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;I see what you&amp;#39;re saying.&amp;#39; He replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;But my theory goes deeper than that.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Go on&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe the reason that our parents generation can&amp;#39;t reach their children is because their religions have become obsolete.  The religions have been rendered obsolete by the invention of the computer.  Religion is a tool, used to bring you closer to God, to involve spirituality in your life.  But just as any tool, it eventually becomes obsolete.  I mean, what&amp;#39;s the dominant religion here in North America?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;d have to say Christianity.&amp;#39; Duane replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s right, but it&amp;#39;s not working anymore.  Well, it still works, but not like it did for our parent&amp;#39;s generation, or for the generations before them.  I know maybe two or three people of all of my friends, and I have thousands of friends, that actually followed their parents, and are some form of Christian and go to church every Sunday.  My family dragged me to church many times, but I never felt a fraction of the spirituality there that I feel here.  I have never felt as close to God, as close to other people as I do here.  I mean it did wondrous things the last two thousand years.  But look at the last thirty years.  Technology has emerged out of nowhere, in the blink of an eye.  It has changed the entire world.  The Internet and computers have changed everything.  There isn&amp;#39;t a thing you do that doesn&amp;#39;t involve computers and technology somehow.  The television you watch is digital, the car you drive has a computer in it, the phones you use are digital, the music you listen is altered through electricity, everything involves technology now.  The Internet has created a global village.  And I think that is why these older religions have stopped working.&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;What do you mean?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe they don&amp;#39;t work because technology isn&amp;#39;t involved in the religion, and that because technology influences us so much everyday and we are so close to our technology that it now has to be involved in our spirituality, or it won&amp;#39;t work.  Now let me ask you something, it will probably be something that you&amp;#39;ve never thought of before.  Do you think technology has a spirit?  Like do you think your computer, or your TV, or your Playstation has a spirit?&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Of course not.&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Why not?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Because it isn&amp;#39;t alive.&amp;#39; He replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Your computer has the same electricity running through it, that runs through your nervous system.  And technology is something we created, Humans have been given a God-like power, the power of creativity.  I believe that anything we create is natural.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;What do call that guy up there, behind the turntables, playing the music?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;A DJ.&amp;#39; He replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Do you know what he really is?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;He&amp;#39;s a shaman.  He&amp;#39;s a techno-shaman.  He&amp;#39;s using the electronic music to invoke certain states of mind, or certain states of being that transcend reality.  He&amp;#39;s no different than the ancient shamans of Africa, or the ancient shamans of Native Americans.  Except he uses technology.  What all those politicians who condemn, and try to shut down raves, all those journalists who write negative things about raves, all those parents who think raves are wrong don&amp;#39;t realize is that raving is a part of being human.  The need to rave in engrained in our spirits.  It&amp;#39;s as natural as the need to have sex, to eat, to sleep.  They don&amp;#39;t realize that people have been raving since the dawn of human existence.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do you mean?  Raves have just recently started.&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;No Duane, we&amp;#39;ve been raving since the dawn of music.  What is the whole point of raving, what do we come here every weekend for?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;To raise our state of consciousness through the power of music and dance, right?&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Right.  What do you think a Pow-wow is?  Native Americans have been raving for thousands upon thousands of years.  They beat their drum, and sing and chant.  They dance in a circle, with their tribe.  There&amp;#39;re using the power of music and dance to raise their state of consciousness.  What do you think an African tribe that is dancing around a fire, chanting, beating drums, wearing ceremonial masks is doing?  They are raving, and the have been for thousands of years.  They used the same tool we use today, the drum, only our drum is digital.  The only thing different about our raves is we are armed with lasers, and electronic music, instead of feathers and animal skin drums.  Do you see?  It&amp;#39;s a part of being human.  Do you remember the first time I made you take off your shirt and dance?  How you didn&amp;#39;t want to, but when you finally did, It felt so natural, so good?  I remember the first time I took off my shirt.  \r\n",
       "\n",
       " I was raving for almost a year, and everyone would always tell me to take of my shirt, and I never did.  Then one day I finally did.  I&amp;#39;ll never forget it.  It felt so right, so natural, I felt like I was part of an ancient African tribe, and I was dancing around a fire.  I&amp;#39;ll never forget that, and now I&amp;#39;ll never rave without some point in the night where I rip my shirt off.&amp;#39; I said.  I paused for a second to catch my breath. &amp;#39;You see that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve lost in today&amp;#39;s world.  We&amp;#39;ve lost our sense of being a tribe.  When you walk down a street at night, and walk by someone you don&amp;#39;t know, you don&amp;#39;t know what this person might do, you ready yourself just in case he might try to rob you or something.  You don&amp;#39;t trust him.  There&amp;#39;s fear, and doubt.  It never used to be like that.  \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We use to be a tribe, that person use to be your brother, or your sister.  You use to love and care about that person.  That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so great about electronic music.  It&amp;#39;s universal; it isn&amp;#39;t influenced by one culture or one part of the world.  It&amp;#39;s made all over the world, influenced by every culture.  It&amp;#39;s universal.  The same vinyl being spun here can be spun in Japan.  Our tribe is coming back together.  Technology is going to bring us all back together, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to save us, not destroy us.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I hope you&amp;#39;re right, I really do.  About our technology saving us, not destroying us, I mean.&amp;#39;  He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Now this is going to sound a little radical, and you might not agree with it, but I&amp;#39;m going to tell you how I feel about technology.  The majority of the world, particularly the religious, is scared of technology.  It scares a lot of people.  But I&amp;#39;m not scared.  They feel it would be wrong to start altering or adding computers to the human body.  But I don&amp;#39;t see it as wrong.  I believe that we should eventually be half man, half machine.  I think we should embrace technology.  Not to become all-artificial.  But find the equilibrium.  The perfect balance between man and machine, to create something better than humans.  You see I don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with technology because it something we created and like I said earlier; I think as long as we created it, it is natural.  Don&amp;#39;t you feel something, like when you are raving, haven&amp;#39;t you felt something else?  I can feel the techno-spirits; I&amp;#39;ll call them that, for lack of a better word.  Don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;#39;  I asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I feel something, but I don&amp;#39;t know what it is.&amp;#39;  He replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe that in ancient times, humans accomplished everything through spirituality.  There are monoliths created by man around the world with giant stones, weighing sixty thousand tons, and these sacred sights were built before the invention of the wheel!  I believe that with spirituality, humans once accomplished anything they could dream of.  But one day we questioned it.  That one-day we questioned it, was the day we lost it.  That was its power, that we didn&amp;#39;t have any doubts, we didn&amp;#39;t have any disbelief, just pure faith.  Adam and Eve took a fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge.  That was the moment we lost our power, because that was its power.  That we had no doubt, no disbelief, only faith.  I also believe that one day when science comes to it&amp;#39;s pinnacle, all that it&amp;#39;s going to figure out, is that we had the perfect technology to begin with, in the beginning we had the only sustainable, and everlasting technology.  Our forests, our animals, nature it self is the perfect technology.  Many believe we are coming the end of the cycle, we are entering a spiritual age.&amp;#39;\r\n",

This beat seemed a step ahead of anything I had ever heard.  It was mind blowing.  I tried to remember the name of this track, or where I had heard it before, but I couldn&amp;#39;t place it.  It was new.  I had never heard it before.\r\n",

I was in some kind of labyrinth.\r\n",

       "Then I looked to the ground near my feet.  A small colored pill on the floor had caught my eye.  I picked it up; it was a small bright green pill with the letters CU engraved into it.  I realized what I had found; it was a legendary green CU ecstasy!  Instinctively I shoved it into my mouth.  I stood up and continued on my way. Just a few feet ahead of me I could see another one.  I ran over to it, picked it up, and had a good look at it.  This time it was a white pill with a stamp of a white smiley face on it.  I ingested it just as quickly as the last.  Then again!  Another pill, just a few feet ahead of this one.  I ran over to it.  This one was a brown butterfly.  Once again, without any hesitation I swallowed it.  The pills continued on, like a trail.  Apparently it was a deliberate trail.  I continued to follow them, eating each one as I picked them up.  There were all kinds of colors and pictures on them, a rainbow of serotonin candy.  I willingly followed the trail through the labyrinth.  It led me down a few hallways, and eventually to a ladder.  I climbed over the ladder.  As I reached over the last few rings of the ladder, I could see a river on this level of the labyrinth.\r\n",

       "As I stood up the feeling of the evil presence grew more intense in my solar plexus.  It was closer now.  I continued following the trail of pills again.  Then suddenly I heard a loud beeping sound.  My alarm clock awakened me from slumber.  I opened my eyes and slowly came to my senses.  The first thing that came to mind was the beat that I had heard in my dream.  In my dream I had heard the beat with perfect clarity, almost as if I had really heard it.  The beat was burnt into my brain.  I looked over at the alarm clock.  It was three-thirty in the afternoon.  Time to get ready for work.  After my morning joint, I prepared my body for meditation with some yoga.  Then I prepared my mind for mediation with my favorite Zen meditation...\r\n",

I gazed out the window at the beautiful cityscape beneath the loving light of the sun.  It was Saturday, my favorite day of the week.  The train gracefully slowed into the next station.

I reached the building where I worked, a classy restaurant on the first floor of a business skyscraper in the city center.  I entered the lobby, security cameras where hanging in every corner.

My nights were filled with steaks, shrimp Hunan&amp;#39;s, green curry, and a whole assortment of exotic and exquisite foods.  Exquisite girls also filled my night.  I would pass my free moments flirting, and talking with the beautiful servers.  I worked the closing shift six nights a week.

       "When we got home I went straight for my weed.  After I got my chronic fix I headed to the kitchen, I was hungry.  We had just moved into our new house.  It cost us everything we had just to get in the door, well with last and first month&amp;#39;s rent.  It also didn&amp;#39;t help that cooks don&amp;#39;t make much more than minimum wage.

I grabbed a few slices of bread and placed them on our toaster.  &amp;#39;Ah, the irony of life, you&amp;#39;re always there for me, sometimes you&amp;#39;re the only one I know I can depend on.&amp;#39; I thought to myself and had to laugh for a minute. \r\n",

So our toaster was a metal coat hanger bent in half and placed on the stove element, so it held the bread just over the element.  I stood there with a smile on my face, watching my toast cook thinking about all the delicious foods I cook all night, night after night for the wealthy people.  Ninety percent of the menu I hadn&amp;#39;t even tried before, I couldn&amp;#39;t afford the cost of these extravagant foods.  So I get to wear my chef&amp;#39;s uniform, and prepare foods like sushi, swordfish, salmon linguini, and chicken Hunan&amp;#39;s, then after work I get to go home and make peanut butter toast on a coat hanger for myself.

Just the way I like it.  Now I am extremely good at dancing, I wouldn&amp;#39;t settle for anything less.  I don&amp;#39;t know why, but when my mind is tripped out, completely ripped, and I&amp;#39;m hallucinating to the point where I don&amp;#39;t have any grip on reality, my dancing becomes out of this world, unbelievable.  I don&amp;#39;t know exactly why, but I guess it opens my mind, makes me think of things and ways I&amp;#39;ve never thought of.  When I go raving, I get myself so high that I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s not.  I can&amp;#39;t have a conversation with someone because I would be talking gibberish, and I have to avoid everyone.  But the reason I do this is because after I stumble around and somehow find my way to the dance floor, my dancing goes intergalactic.

       "I was ready now; my high was perfect, I could tell by my hallucinations.  When I became extremely high on psychedelics my vision became digital-like.  Instead of natural curves and shapes, everything took on unnatural, digital-like shapes.  It was like a low-quality video clip on your computer.  If my vision was compared to a computer monitor resolution, then when I was sober I would see with perfect clarity, my resolution would be 3200 x 2400, but when I was tripped out on LSD or mushrooms, my resolution was like 320 x 240.  If you were standing in front of me your body was composed of about 30 pixels, or 30 large differently shaded squares.  I loved it.  I was half man, half-machine.  Sometimes it scared me, it felt so good to be in this state, to become one with technology, but at the same time something inside told me it was wrong.  But I couldn&amp;#39;t stop; it felt too good, even if I did have doubts. \r\n",

       "After a little dancing, it was time for the guest DJ.  A large older European man got behind the decks.  I found a spot to stand and see what he had for a bit.  I had not seen or heard him yet.  Immediately he began to rock the house like I had never seen.  I stood there for about a half an hour in awe as he played track after track, taking everyone high and higher.  The vibrations and energy of everyone grew to a level I had never experience before.  I saw DJ Anthem ten feet away from me.  I ran over to him, his eyes were fixated up towards the DJ booth.\r\n",

       "The loud music pounded me in an absolutely unbelievable rhythmic and soothing synchronic manner.  The speakers a few feet away from me continuously fired beat after beat at me.  I could feel the vibrations from the powerful speakers rattle my insides.  I sat alone, perched upon a stage next to the dance floor.  I was slouched over staring down at the floor watching the little spots of light glide gracefully across the floor.  They had been cast upon the floor by the light and laser machines suspended above me.  The spots would all move in different directions from each other for a few moments, then they&amp;#39;d all start to move in the same direction in total unity.  That was the part I liked.  Unity is one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced.  I continued to sit there, deep in thought.  \r\n",

       "Dolby was taking us to a new reality, a reality where only peace, love, unity, and respect existed.  I began to feel at one with everyone.  One by one, each person arrived onto the same wavelength.  Until everyone was riding the same wavelength.  The energy here in this world was so loving, so positive.  Perfect synchrony.  Dolby chased every last bit of chaos from the real world out of the Warehouse.  Chaos was cast out.  Chaos did not exist here, it couldn&amp;#39;t exist in here.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "I sat quietly waiting for the right track to pick me up and place me on the dance floor.  The Warehouse began to travel further and further away from the chaotic reality we lived in, until we had escaped the material world.  We had broken free.  I closed my eyes, and began to collect some energy.  I inhaled through my nose, held for a second, and exhaled through my mouth.  I continued the meditative breathing, imagining in my mind light colored positive energy entering as I inhaled, and negative dark colored energy leaving as I exhaled.  With each breath I envisioned my energy growing larger and larger with each breath, like a giant cloud of energy all around my body, growing larger with each breath, until my energy cloud engulfed the entire Warehouse.  I began to let go and surrender.  The energy began to send a familiar feeling that pulsated throughout my body.  It began in my head then moved out to the ends of my arms and legs.  It felt like a cool tingling sensation that was running through my insides.  As I collected a surplus of positive energy, my heart and my spirit began to throttle.  Vibrating faster and stronger with each electronic pulse, my spirit began to pull my body to the floor, but not yet.\r\n",

       "Again and again, track after track, just when you thought there was no way it could get any better, no way it could get any more beautiful, anymore perfect, Dolby would blow your mind up and drop a track that you&amp;#39;ve never heard, a track somehow better than the last, just at the perfect moment.  The Massive erupted in a fury of euphoric screams.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "The almost magnetic-like pull emanating from the floor grew stronger and more powerful with every revolutionary beat.  Thump, thump, thump.  Then all of a sudden it happened.  Dolby flicked that switch and dropped the next track.  My spirit went into total shock. I was paralyzed.  The track was unbelievable, so revolutionary, and so perfectly timed, and so synchronous that I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was hearing.  It was the beat from my dream!  I had not heard this track until now.  I was completely scared yet my mind was on a level that I knew would change me for the rest of my life.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "It is time.  I opened my eyes I found myself in the middle of the front stage, in front of Dolby and the DJ booth.  Yet I could not remember standing up and walking here, it was almost as if I had just appeared there with no physical movement.  I surrendered, my limbs and body began to release and pour out my unimaginable inspiration.  I let go of my ego.  This is not me, I am one with everything, the music, the earth, the people.   I began living in the moment, no past, no future, only now.  I could feel the energy of the other dancers, the music, and the Earth.  I just allowed the energy to pass through me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Here it comes.  The revolutionary music power pierced through the speakers and hit me, in that millisecond I transformed it into untainted pure rhythm.  My moves were inhuman, out of this world.  With cold machine-like precision my inspiration commanded everyone&amp;#39;s eyes, everyone&amp;#39;s energy, everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.  They could not believe what they were seeing, it was changing them, changing the way they thought and lived.  I could hear people start screaming and cheering for me in pure euphoria.  I could not believe it.  It began to ease everyone&amp;#39;s hearts, they became paralyzed, their eyes fixated upon me.  Their spirits began feeding and charging themselves from my inspiration.  It became our inspiration.  The beads of sweat ran down my face and chest.  I was breathing heavily, trying to catch my breath.  One by one, each dancer stopped, either by exhaustion, or pure bewilderment.  Until everyone was stopped, watching me in amazement.  I could feel each spirit, each individual soul.  The energy passing through me was unfathomable.  It felt like a waterfall of gushing pure, positive, loving energy was running though my veins.  The moment lasted an eternity.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Then it happened.  I began to hear, and receive everyone&amp;#39;s thoughts.  I could hear two hundred different voices in my head.  Everyone was pleading for me not to stop.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Keep going!&amp;#39; one voice whispered.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;No, don&amp;#39;t stop,&amp;#39; another voice asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Next my dance came to its unimaginable meta-physical climax.  The beat disappeared.  Just the beautiful sound of the all-loving electronic siren soothing and easing our hearts.  I turned around, and dropped to my knees.  The sweat dripping from my body, my lungs desperately tried to catch my breath.  I had become like a sun, the energy-giving center upon which everyone&amp;#39;s destinies and lives revolved.  I had become the vision on my youth.  Men and women hung upon my inspiration, our inspiration, and reshaped their characters.  From now on I would dance and lives would be changed. \r\n",

       "Something was different now.  Something had happened.  I felt like a leader of some sort.  Like we were no longer individuals, but like we were one mean, lean, raving machine.  We were all different parts of something bigger than us, bigger than this world, this reality, and at the center of it all was me, like a heart pumping pure loving energy to everyone.  I looked at all the people, everyone looked back at me in complete awe, and I returned the same look of awe back.  Nobody could believe let alone comprehend what had just happened.  \r\n",

It felt like they looked to me as if I was some sort of light leading them from the darkness.  Yet no words had past through our mouths.  Not even a nod of a head.  Yet I said it, and they heard it. I walked away, and pulled the hood of my Jedi cloak on again to shroud my face in shadows.  I left my people in their and my new awakened state.  I walked out the door.  It felt like I was watching a movie now, not like I was in a movie anymore.  I had never felt this refreshed, this much love, this kind of energy ever before in my life.  It felt like I had just run through a rainforest. This one moment changed me forever.\r\n",

The colors, the clouds, it couldn&amp;#39;t be expressed in words.  I saw three other ravers sitting on a ledge looking up to it.  I walked over to them.  One of them looked at me and just said,\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;I know&amp;#39; acknowledging the beauty of this sunrise.  I jumped up on the ledge and sat in silence with them.  As I looked over at the Warehouse one by one, almost everyone filed out of the Warehouse to see this sunrise.  Everyone was running in to get his or her friends.  It was so beautiful that you didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to miss it.  I ran in and got Duane and brought him out, we sat in the vehicle and just watched the sunrise in paralyzed by its beauty for about twenty minutes.  Then we decided to go back in listen to rest of Dolby&amp;#39;s set.\r\n",

It felt like, no I knew, I was the one who was going to lead this revolution.  We were going to change the world, regenerate it, and this revolution began in that everlasting moment.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;First, let me tell you how I approach my dancing first.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;A lot of people think that the reason I dance is to be the best, or look the best.  They feel that my dancing is all about me.  I can see it in their eyes.

       "&amp;#39;What I try to do everyday is to show people what is possible, I want to inspire people, to inspire them so much that they have no choice but to join in.  Once they start dancing, I hope they will experience the freedom, the energy, and spirituality, I have found in the music and dancing.  It is the most spiritual thing I have ever experienced, and I want to share that with every single person I can.  My dancing is about liberating other people&amp;#39;s spirits, so they transcend the material world and enter a more spiritual world.  I try lead people away from the darkness.  I hope I have inspired you somehow.&amp;#39;\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;You have!&amp;#39; He replied. &amp;#39;I do, I do want to dance, but I&amp;#39;m too scared to go out on the dance floor, I&amp;#39;m afraid of how, I&amp;#39;ll look.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I remember when I first started raving, I was in the same position.  I was too scared to go out, I was too worried that I&amp;#39;d look like an idiot.  For the first three months of raving, I didn&amp;#39;t even think about stepping on the dance floor.  But then one night, I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened, but I just found myself on the dance floor, and I was dancing!  It was awesome.  So what I tell everyone, who tells me that they don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable about going on the dance floor is; to just keep coming out, keep coming to the raves and just sit and watch the other dancers, and listen to the music, and eventually one night you&amp;#39;ll come out and out of nowhere you&amp;#39;ll find yourself on the dance floor.  You&amp;#39;ll be dancing and you&amp;#39;ll have no idea how it happened.  It will just happen.  Don&amp;#39;t push it, just keep coming out, and when you&amp;#39;re ready you&amp;#39;ll find yourself doing it, not knowing how it happened.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Thanks, for the advice, really thanks,&amp;#39; he said.  &amp;#39;Anytime bro, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m here for.&amp;#39; I replied. &amp;#39;Once you begin dancing, whenever that happens, remember don&amp;#39;t push it, just start watching the other dancers, and how they move their bodies.  That&amp;#39;s how I learned my first few moves, was I copied them from other people.  But try not to copy other people, you will get no respect that way, just try to use their moves as a guide to find your style.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;My style?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah, before I tell you about your style, I first have to explain to you what dancing is.&amp;#39; I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay&amp;#39; he said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Music is a power.  One of the strongest powers on Earth, in fact it is so strong that in ancient times, the church controlled music, you were only allowed to make it for and in church.  So now you know music is a power, I&amp;#39;ll tell you how to utilize that power.  What dancing is is the pure act of metamorphosis.  The DJ is sending out this music power, and the instant that it hits you, you transform this music power as best as you can into physical power.  As you get better and better at dancing, you become better at instantly transforming that music energy into a physical energy.  Think of it like painting a picture.  This relates to your style as I said earlier.  If everyone were to paint a picture, no picture would be the same.  We are all individual&amp;#39;s and we would all have different expressions.  Dancing is obviously a form of expression, a physical one.  So after awhile of dancing, your dance will evolve into your own individual expression, you&amp;#39;ll have your own style.  Look at all these people dancing here, they all have their own individual styles, they are all expressing their present emotions in their own individual way.&amp;#39; I said.  He looked at few of the dancers and looked back at me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I see what you&amp;#39;re saying; it&amp;#39;s all making sense to me.  It all sounds so right.  Where do you learn this stuff?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;The Underground&amp;#39; I replied smiling.  We sat there for a few moments.  Then he asked,\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Did you do anything tonight?  I mean did you do any drugs.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah.  I did some Acid.&amp;#39; I replied.  I could tell this completely stunned him.  He moved his body back in amazement.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What?  Acid?&amp;#39;  He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well it&amp;#39;s the only drug that still makes me a better dancer.  I owe all my dancing to drugs.&amp;#39;  I replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;How can you handle it, and keep yourself in public?  I mean I&amp;#39;ve tried it a few times when I was younger, but I couldn&amp;#39;t be public while on it.&amp;#39;  He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well, first off, what most ravers today don&amp;#39;t know, is that, Acid was all ravers did back in the day, there was no Ecstasy.  Ecstasy only began to become very popular in the earlier nineties.  I know what you&amp;#39;re saying though about handling it.  Ninety-nine percent of the population doesn&amp;#39;t posses the ability to channel LSD positively, for ninety-nine out of one hundred people; they can only channel the LSD negatively, and have bad experiences.  But what I tell people is that when you are able to channel LSD positively, the level it takes your mind to it is unbelievable.  When I am dancing on Acid, I have control of every little muscle, every tendon, and every part of my body, parts I didn&amp;#39;t even know I had.  It&amp;#39;s wild.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes when I do a spin, which is probably a quarter of a second, it will go in slow motion, and the spin will last for three seconds.  Shrooms are good too, but they make me tired and don&amp;#39;t give me any energy.  LSD is such a powerful psychedelic that it is also like a super amphetamine.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Wow.&amp;#39; he replied, sitting there not knowing what to say.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong though, when I first started raving it was all Ecstasy.  I ate it like it was going out of style.  I owe all my whole dancing career to Ecstasy.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do you mean?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well that&amp;#39;s another key to dancing, well for me anyhow.  Ecstasy opened the door for me.  It showed me what was possible.  In the beginning it gave me the courage and confidence to start dancing.  I was very insecure before.  But what Ecstasy does, is it removes all your fears.  Your fear of looking stupid, your fear of saying something stupid.  When that happens, all that is left is the real you.  You aren&amp;#39;t afraid of being yourself, of what other people think.  You stop fronting or stop wearing a mask.  But in my experiences, Ecstasy can only take you so far.  My dancing got to a point where I was performing extraordinary moves that required all of my balance.  Ecstasy impairs your balance, so it was holding me back at that point.  So I experimented with shrooms and LSD, and I found that the Acid took me to levels I never thought were possible.  But don&amp;#39;t forget without the Ecstasy I would have never walked through that door.&amp;#39; I replied.  He was hanging on to my every word.  I could tell that he could of sat there all night and listened to me.\r\n",

It would be too much for you to try to absorb everything in one sitting.  I think you&amp;#39;ve got a lot to think about already, cause I&amp;#39;m going to get out there and do some dancing.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",

       "&amp;#39;Okay stand up,&amp;#39; I said.  He stood up.  &amp;#39;Let me explain what I&amp;#39;m going to do to you.  It was done to me when I first started raving, and I didn&amp;#39;t understand it and it&amp;#39;s significance for a few years.&amp;#39;  I sprayed his forehead with water. &amp;#39;It&amp;#39;s like being baptized.  Water represents life.  I&amp;#39;m not trying to make fun of Christianity or anything.  There&amp;#39;s tremendous power in symbolism.  This means that you belong to a tribe now.&amp;#39; I said, and smiled at him.  I could tell he sort of understood me.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay.&amp;#39; he said.  I started to turn away and he held out his hand to shake my hand.  I was just about to say something and he realized this and instead made a fist.  I smiled and nodded my head and we hit fists. &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;ll talk to you later bro.&amp;#39;  I said.  &amp;#39;Alright, Miles&amp;#39; he replied.  He smiled and sat back down.

       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Okay.  The next few things are rather simple, and there really isn&amp;#39;t anything that deep or special to them.  Now you just simply have to apply discipline to your dancing.  You need to train your body.  Now, however much you chose to practice, and train, is up to you.  There&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with only practicing when you are out raving on the weekends.  Raving isn&amp;#39;t a competition.  But I like to practice everyday, every morning, by practicing everyday, I won&amp;#39;t only take my level of dancing up, but I&amp;#39;ll take the level of everyone who watches me and dances with me up.  So however much you decide to practice is entirely up to you, but the more you practice, the faster your dance will evolve.&amp;#39; I said.  He continued to sit there listening.  &amp;#39;Now I&amp;#39;m the kind of person, where I have to be the best at everything I do, if I&amp;#39;m not, then I will practice until I am.  But that&amp;#39;s just me, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s very natural though, because I use to practice so much, that I would lose toenails.  My toenails would turn blue and fall off. I&amp;#39;ve lost about ten of them in my life.  I&amp;#39;ve also had two stress fractures, in my metatarsals in my left foot.  So I was a little extreme.  I&amp;#39;m not expecting this from you, or from anybody for that matter, it&amp;#39;s just a work ethic I&amp;#39;ve developed from my basketball playing days, and from growing up watching and listening to my hero Michael Jordan all my life.&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;But how do I know what to do when I practice?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Well what I did was study video of the best.  The one person I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;ve studied the most in my life would have to be Michael Jackson.  I downloaded as many video clips as I could find of Michael Jackson on the Internet, and I would watch his clips over and over and over, for months on end.  When I saw a move I would watch it over and over and over, then go and practice and practice and practice, till I could do it.  But whom you watch obviously depends on what styles of dancing you&amp;#39;re trying to learn.  Like I still watch video clips of the masters everyday, I watch all styles; Freestyles, Breakdancing, Popping and Locking, Liquid, Flagging, Glowsticking, and Fire Dancing.  Remember the body cannot do what it cannot visualize first.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Visualize?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yes, that is the other technique I was going to share with you today.  Visualization is a technique used by athletes at the top of their sports.  Like Olympic powerlifters, or NBA basketball players.  You see everything in this world is created twice, the first creation is mentally, and then the second comes the physical creation.  You have to visualize your moves in your mind first, see yourself doing it in your mind.  Sometimes when I couldn&amp;#39;t perform a move I had been trying to do for months, I would sit down, close my eyes and for about five or ten minutes just try to picture myself doing it in my mind.  Then I would get up and try it, and a lot of time it would happen.  But if it doesn&amp;#39;t work, don&amp;#39;t get discouraged, I&amp;#39;ve had some moves take up three months before I actually pulled it off.  In fact two moves of the moves I&amp;#39;m currently working on I have been visualizing and practicing for over two years already but I still haven&amp;#39;t actually pulled them off yet.&amp;#39; I said. &amp;#39;Remember the body cannot do what the mind cannot visualize first.&amp;#39; He sat there nodding his head; I could tell by the way he was half squinting his eyes that he was thinking about everything I had just told him.  I continued on, &amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t think anybody has said it better than Morpheus in the movie the Matrix; you&amp;#39;re better (faster) than this, don&amp;#39;t think you are, know you are.&amp;#39; I said.  We both smiled.  &amp;#39;You have to let it all go, fear, doubt, and disbelief ... free your mind.&amp;#39; I said again, obviously quoting Morpheus again.  I continued on jokingly, &amp;#39;But that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve got those red pills for right? So did you take the red or the blue pill?&amp;#39; I asked him, smiling.  &amp;#39;The red one. &amp;#39; He said, laughing back. Then he promptly asked, &amp;#39;What about you Miles, did you take the red pill?&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;Actually I took two of them.&amp;#39; I said, followed by a big smile, we both had a good laugh.  We continued to talk for bit more about some other stuff.  Then we went and danced.  At the end of the night I told him when he&amp;#39;s ready, I&amp;#39;d teach him some more.\r\n",

       "Over the next four or five weekends I ran into Jason a few times, and we would talk, and I would show him some of my moves, and different styles.  I let him try my flags, and my glowsticking chains, to see how he handled them.  I also tried showing him some liquid, and taught him a few breakdancing moves.  Then one night I felt he was ready to learn the last few secrets I knew, and had experienced myself.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Alright young Jedi, I think you&amp;#39;re ready for some more.&amp;#39; I said, with a smile on my face.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m listening, Miles&amp;#39; Jason replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;One of the secrets I have today is just simply one word.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;One word?&amp;#39; He asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yeah.  Surrender.  That one simple word made a world of difference in my level of dancing.  Before I used to try to dance, or try to dance better, and I would try harder and harder.  But the harder I tried the more difficult it became.  I was trying to force my dancing.  It won&amp;#39;t work like that.  You have to surrender to the music, you have to surrender to your dancing, surrender to the energy.  You have to live in the moment.  It&amp;#39;s almost as if you stop dancing, and instead you are sitting on the side, just watching yourself dance.  You become detached from the dance yet engaged in the dance.&amp;#39;  I replied.  Then I asked, &amp;#39;Do you grasp what I am saying?&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;Well, sort of.&amp;#39;  He replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Don&amp;#39;t worry if you don&amp;#39;t understand it yet, you will.  With practice you will come to understand my teachings.&amp;#39;   He sat there I could tell his mind was slowly, yet surely metabolizing the insights I was feeding him.  &amp;#39;There was this one quote that I came across on the Internet one day, and I liked it.  I felt it encompassed a lot of what we live in one sentence.  It was; &amp;#39;Music is our scripture, dance is our practice, once united, we can&amp;#39;t be divided, feel the bass. PLUR&amp;#39;.  Now there was one final insight that I wanted to share with you tonight.  The level of mastery that you covet so much cannot be reached until you let go of your ego.  You have to get your ego out of it.  You have to realize that it isn&amp;#39;t you performing the moves.  It isn&amp;#39;t about being the best, or looking the best.  Your ego will only hold you back.  You have to just allow the energy to pass through you.  You have to almost say &amp;#39;this isn&amp;#39;t me, I&amp;#39;m just allowing the energy to pass through me&amp;#39;.  When you discard your ego, anything will be possible.  Now I have nothing more to teach you.  Your vision is a promise of what one day you will be.  The strength of your efforts will be the measure of your results.  You will become the vision of your youth one-day Jason.  Go, and dance, because if you didn&amp;#39;t come here to dance, then what the fuck did you come here for?!&amp;#39;\r\n",

       "Definition of a shaman: The ability to readily slip out of the perceptual boundaries that demarcate his or her particular culture- boundaries reinforced by social customs, taboos, and most importantly, the common speech or language- in order to make contact with and learn from, the other powers in the land.  His magic is precisely his heightened receptivity to the meaningful solicitations- songs, cries, gestures- of the larger, more-than-human field.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;The same way I got through to you.  You were once lost, just as he is, and so was I at one time.&amp;#39; I said, then I continued.  &amp;#39;Our raving is the most spiritual thing in our lives right.  You know how we call the Warehouse our church right?  It&amp;#39;s our weekly ritual.  We couldn&amp;#39;t possibly think of living without raving right?  The music and the dancing have raised our state of consciousness.  It was here that we found ourselves.  It was here that we found peace, love, unity, and respect.  It was here that we found our people, our tribe.  Before you met me, before I found the Warehouse, or should I say the Warehouse found me.  I was a little punk thug drug dealer.  All I did was drink, have sex and sell and do drugs.  You told me that before the Warehouse all you did was steal, that you were a professional thief with your gang, and you stole to get drugs.  Well I sold drugs to get my drugs.  Today&amp;#39;s youth doesn&amp;#39;t listen to their elders.  All kids want to do is do drugs.  Drugs plague our generation.  But don&amp;#39;t you see that&amp;#39;s one of the whole keys to it all, bro.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What key?&amp;#39; he asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What&amp;#39;s the only thing today&amp;#39;s youth want to do?&amp;#39; I asked him.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Like you said, drugs, and sex.&amp;#39; he replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Yes, and everyone is trying to talk, to counsel, to guide these kids.  They are our future.  But they don&amp;#39;t listen.  Every year, it just gets worse and worse.  Many have given up hope.  They feel it&amp;#39;s too late.&amp;#39;  I said, then continued.  &amp;#39;But that&amp;#39;s the trick, that&amp;#39;s how they reached me, and that&amp;#39;s how I reached you.  Was through the drugs.  We give them this Ecstasy, and we say &amp;#39;Here take this!  It feels great doesn&amp;#39;t it?  Want some more?  Of course you do, here!&amp;#39;  It&amp;#39;s the only way we can reach them, through their drugs.  So then they start coming out every weekend to get high, and they love it.  But while they are here, while they are high, we show them what it&amp;#39;s all about. PEACE,LOVE,UNITY,RESPECT.  We show them the power of music.  We show them the power of dance.  We bring them into our world.  We change them.  Then when they are ready, after they start seeing that, we walk over and tell them something.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do we tell them?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;The same thing that was told to me, and the same thing that I told you.  That they are coming for the wrong reasons.  They are coming for the drugs, when they should be coming for the music, and dancing, for the unity.  When you tell them that, they realize it.  They think, &amp;#39;I am coming for the wrong reasons&amp;#39;.  But at that point the power of the music and dance, the power of the unity has affected them so deeply that they start coming for the right reasons.  But do you think if we tried to reach that kid normally, tried to teach him about spirituality, that he would of listened?  You think we would have had any opportunity to change him with out the drugs?  You think I could walk up to a group of high school kids on the street and try to teach them anything about spirituality?  They&amp;#39;d all laugh at me.  But one day that kid over there is going to be coming for the right reasons, sure he still might get high when he comes, but that won&amp;#39;t be the main reason he comes.  He&amp;#39;ll be coming for the music, and the dancing, and the unity.  One day he&amp;#39;ll be a true raver.&amp;#39;\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;I see what you&amp;#39;re saying.&amp;#39; He replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;But my theory goes deeper than that.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Go on&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe the reason that our parents generation can&amp;#39;t reach their children is because their religions have become obsolete.  The religions have been rendered obsolete by the invention of the computer.  Religion is a tool, used to bring you closer to God, to involve spirituality in your life.  But just as any tool, it eventually becomes obsolete.  I mean, what&amp;#39;s the dominant religion here in North America?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;d have to say Christianity.&amp;#39; Duane replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;That&amp;#39;s right, but it&amp;#39;s not working anymore.  Well, it still works, but not like it did for our parent&amp;#39;s generation, or for the generations before them.  I know maybe two or three people of all of my friends, and I have thousands of friends, that actually followed their parents, and are some form of Christian and go to church every Sunday.  My family dragged me to church many times, but I never felt a fraction of the spirituality there that I feel here.  I have never felt as close to God, as close to other people as I do here.  I mean it did wondrous things the last two thousand years.  But look at the last thirty years.  Technology has emerged out of nowhere, in the blink of an eye.  It has changed the entire world.  The Internet and computers have changed everything.  There isn&amp;#39;t a thing you do that doesn&amp;#39;t involve computers and technology somehow.  The television you watch is digital, the car you drive has a computer in it, the phones you use are digital, the music you listen is altered through electricity, everything involves technology now.  The Internet has created a global village.  And I think that is why these older religions have stopped working.&amp;#39;  &amp;#39;What do you mean?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe they don&amp;#39;t work because technology isn&amp;#39;t involved in the religion, and that because technology influences us so much everyday and we are so close to our technology that it now has to be involved in our spirituality, or it won&amp;#39;t work.  Now let me ask you something, it will probably be something that you&amp;#39;ve never thought of before.  Do you think technology has a spirit?  Like do you think your computer, or your TV, or your Playstation has a spirit?&amp;#39;\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Of course not.&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Why not?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;Because it isn&amp;#39;t alive.&amp;#39; He replied.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Your computer has the same electricity running through it, that runs through your nervous system.  And technology is something we created, Humans have been given a God-like power, the power of creativity.  I believe that anything we create is natural.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;What do call that guy up there, behind the turntables, playing the music?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",

       "&amp;#39;Do you know what he really is?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;What?&amp;#39; Duane asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;He&amp;#39;s a shaman.  He&amp;#39;s a techno-shaman.  He&amp;#39;s using the electronic music to invoke certain states of mind, or certain states of being that transcend reality.  He&amp;#39;s no different than the ancient shamans of Africa, or the ancient shamans of Native Americans.  Except he uses technology.  What all those politicians who condemn, and try to shut down raves, all those journalists who write negative things about raves, all those parents who think raves are wrong don&amp;#39;t realize is that raving is a part of being human.  The need to rave in engrained in our spirits.  It&amp;#39;s as natural as the need to have sex, to eat, to sleep.  They don&amp;#39;t realize that people have been raving since the dawn of human existence.&amp;#39;  I said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;What do you mean?  Raves have just recently started.&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;No Duane, we&amp;#39;ve been raving since the dawn of music.  What is the whole point of raving, what do we come here every weekend for?&amp;#39; I asked.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;To raise our state of consciousness through the power of music and dance, right?&amp;#39; He said.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Right.  What do you think a Pow-wow is?  Native Americans have been raving for thousands upon thousands of years.  They beat their drum, and sing and chant.  They dance in a circle, with their tribe.  There&amp;#39;re using the power of music and dance to raise their state of consciousness.  What do you think an African tribe that is dancing around a fire, chanting, beating drums, wearing ceremonial masks is doing?  They are raving, and the have been for thousands of years.  They used the same tool we use today, the drum, only our drum is digital.  The only thing different about our raves is we are armed with lasers, and electronic music, instead of feathers and animal skin drums.  Do you see?  It&amp;#39;s a part of being human.  Do you remember the first time I made you take off your shirt and dance?  How you didn&amp;#39;t want to, but when you finally did, It felt so natural, so good?  I remember the first time I took off my shirt.  \r\n",
       "\n",
       " I was raving for almost a year, and everyone would always tell me to take of my shirt, and I never did.  Then one day I finally did.  I&amp;#39;ll never forget it.  It felt so right, so natural, I felt like I was part of an ancient African tribe, and I was dancing around a fire.  I&amp;#39;ll never forget that, and now I&amp;#39;ll never rave without some point in the night where I rip my shirt off.&amp;#39; I said.  I paused for a second to catch my breath. &amp;#39;You see that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;ve lost in today&amp;#39;s world.  We&amp;#39;ve lost our sense of being a tribe.  When you walk down a street at night, and walk by someone you don&amp;#39;t know, you don&amp;#39;t know what this person might do, you ready yourself just in case he might try to rob you or something.  You don&amp;#39;t trust him.  There&amp;#39;s fear, and doubt.  It never used to be like that.  \r\n",
       "\n",
       "We use to be a tribe, that person use to be your brother, or your sister.  You use to love and care about that person.  That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s so great about electronic music.  It&amp;#39;s universal; it isn&amp;#39;t influenced by one culture or one part of the world.  It&amp;#39;s made all over the world, influenced by every culture.  It&amp;#39;s universal.  The same vinyl being spun here can be spun in Japan.  Our tribe is coming back together.  Technology is going to bring us all back together, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s going to save us, not destroy us.&amp;#39; I said.\r\n",

       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;Now this is going to sound a little radical, and you might not agree with it, but I&amp;#39;m going to tell you how I feel about technology.  The majority of the world, particularly the religious, is scared of technology.  It scares a lot of people.  But I&amp;#39;m not scared.  They feel it would be wrong to start altering or adding computers to the human body.  But I don&amp;#39;t see it as wrong.  I believe that we should eventually be half man, half machine.  I think we should embrace technology.  Not to become all-artificial.  But find the equilibrium.  The perfect balance between man and machine, to create something better than humans.  You see I don&amp;#39;t see anything wrong with technology because it something we created and like I said earlier; I think as long as we created it, it is natural.  Don&amp;#39;t you feel something, like when you are raving, haven&amp;#39;t you felt something else?  I can feel the techno-spirits; I&amp;#39;ll call them that, for lack of a better word.  Don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;#39;  I asked.\r\n",
       "\n",
       "&amp;#39;I feel something, but I don&amp;#39;t know what it is.&amp;#39;  He replied.\r\n",
       "&amp;#39;I believe that in ancient times, humans accomplished everything through spirituality.  There are monoliths created by man around the world with giant stones, weighing sixty thousand tons, and these sacred sights were built before the invention of the wheel!  I believe that with spirituality, humans once accomplished anything they could dream of.  But one day we questioned it.  That one-day we questioned it, was the day we lost it.  That was its power, that we didn&amp;#39;t have any doubts, we didn&amp;#39;t have any disbelief, just pure faith.  Adam and Eve took a fruit from the forbidden tree of knowledge.  That was the moment we lost our power, because that was its power.  That we had no doubt, no disbelief, only faith.  I also believe that one day when science comes to it&amp;#39;s pinnacle, all that it&amp;#39;s going to figure out, is that we had the perfect technology to begin with, in the beginning we had the only sustainable, and everlasting technology.  Our forests, our animals, nature it self is the perfect technology.  Many believe we are coming the end of the cycle, we are entering a spiritual age.&amp;#39;\r\n",

I took it to the next level last night, by freebasing 60mg of DMT, and taking a nitrous balloon. I set up the room like I always do, by turning off all the lights, telling everyone to turn off their phones, and bringing the big giant bean bag into the quietest room in the house. This time, I put in some little earplugs, bought from a hardware store, into my ears. I bought them to block out all the cars and other noises from my apartment while meditating, so I feel entirely comfortable with them in. I laid down on the beanbag in the dark room with the glass dick (meth pipe) in my hand, waiting for my friends to come in there so we could begin. They came in and sat down, with an extra lighter, and the whipped cream dispenser, with nitrous tanks, and balloons.

My intentions were to go as far as possible into the &amp;#39;Machine Elf universe&amp;#39;, so I made sure I did it right.

It started off and there was a shit ton of powder in the little pipe, we wondered if it would be easy to burn it all. The powder in the pipe almost instantly turned to a liquid when the intense butane flame was held up to it. I assumed it was done and pulled the pipe up to my lips and inhaled, and got a trace amount of smoke. 123 handed me the balloon full of nitrous, and I took down about half of it, and laid back. I laid there with my eyes closed, waiting for it to hit. About five seconds went by and I knew it didnt work, and I held up my arms in a shrug and said I dunno, it didnt work. So they told me to hit the pipe again. I sat back up and this time started roasting the bowl as I inhaled, and instantly thick clouds of DMT smoke poured into my face, as I inhaled it, I exhaled it through my nose (although I didnt know at the time) and then inhaled again. When I exhaled the last big cloud of smoke I was already tripping balls, and then 123 shoved the half deflated balloon up to my face and I took a tiny bit more, but was tripping too hard, and leaned back onto the beanbag.\r\n",

When my brain made that connection my attention to these creatures changed from trying to figure out where I was, to trying to understand every word that they were telling me. I felt very comfortable in this world, I felt that these beings had known me forever, and they were very pleased to see me visiting them. There was a very happy, informative tone, like they were trying to explain the entire universe in 15 seconds or some extreme shit, ha. Whatever it was that they were saying, it really affected me. It felt like music to me, but like no music I had ever heard before. I felt inspired and wanted to take all this noise and turn it into a song, and share it with the world. Perhaps I will have to go back over to the other side one day and learn their dialogue.\r\n",

The intense light that surrounded me, started becoming dim. I believe I opened my eyes shortly after I left their world... and I looked around entirely confused. How could this be, how could I be in this room? It was dark, and silent, but I was just in a room chalk full of color and commotion. I looked around in dismay, and removed the earplugs from my ear (I use earplugs while meditating to help black out all distractions) and listened to the silence for a while. The earplugs actually really saved me, apparently ABCs phone went off, and he had to get up out of the room to turn it off, but I have no recollection of this happening. Usually little outside distractions like that pull me out of the trip and ruin it for me, but I was so deep in the trip, I had no idea that had even happened.\r\n",

       "Things slowly turned back to normal. After I was fully out of the world, the visuals were still going. I read online that taking nitrous with DMT lengthens the effects of the visuals after the trip is over. The speckles on the wall were swirling, and everything I looked at had a bit of a swirl action going on. As always after smoking DMT, the light was very bright, and alluring... like a bug to a bug zapper. Usually after tripping, I stand up and feel ultra light, like I could just float through the ceiling, but I was so in amazement about what had happened, that I remained seated for quite a while, playing over and over again in my head what just happened. My friends were asking me what just happened, and it took me quite a while till I could put what just happened into words. I mentioned later that my nostrils stung, and 123 informed me that I had exhaled the hit through my nostrils, so that explained why that was.\r\n",

       "What I found to be funny, after each of my friends tried it after me (both DMT and nitrous) was that both of their first signs of life was a laugh. I heard a small heh come out of each of their mouths when they started coming back, but I had no type of laughter. I being the most experienced with DMT out of all of them, used to find my smaller doses funny, but I found this particular trip to be rather enlightening... I am eager to go back to the other side, but wont do it for a while. I think we are going to do some experimenting with the drug, like listening to certain songs, and they will try out open eyed trips (Ive already done the open eye trip, the closed eye is honestly where its at). The question is, next time, do I go above and beyond 60mg? I guess we will have to wait and see.&quot;&gt;\n",

There was a very happy, informative tone, like they were trying to explain the entire universe in 15 seconds or some extreme shit, ha. Whatever it was that they were saying, it really affected me. It felt like music to me, but like no music I had ever heard before. I felt inspired and wanted to take all this noise and turn it into a song, and share it with the world. Perhaps I will have to go back over to the other side one day and learn their dialogue.\r\n",

       "The thing was, as soon as I realized that DMT had caused me to have these feelings, I started fading out of it, just like when you realize youre in a dream. The intense light that surrounded me, started becoming dim. I believe I opened my eyes shortly after I left their world... and I looked around entirely confused. How could this be, how could I be in this room? It was dark, and silent, but I was just in a room chalk full of color and commotion. I looked around in dismay, and removed the earplugs from my ear (I use earplugs while meditating to help black out all distractions) and listened to the silence for a while. The earplugs actually really saved me, apparently ABCs phone went off, and he had to get up out of the room to turn it off, but I have no recollection of this happening. Usually little outside distractions like that pull me out of the trip and ruin it for me, but I was so deep in the trip, I had no idea that had even happened.\r\n",

       "Things slowly turned back to normal. After I was fully out of the world, the visuals were still going. I read online that taking nitrous with DMT lengthens the effects of the visuals after the trip is over. The speckles on the wall were swirling, and everything I looked at had a bit of a swirl action going on. As always after smoking DMT, the light was very bright, and alluring... like a bug to a bug zapper. Usually after tripping, I stand up and feel ultra light, like I could just float through the ceiling, but I was so in amazement about what had happened, that I remained seated for quite a while, playing over and over again in my head what just happened. My friends were asking me what just happened, and it took me quite a while till I could put what just happened into words. I mentioned later that my nostrils stung, and 123 informed me that I had exhaled the hit through my nostrils, so that explained why that was.\r\n",

       "What I found to be funny, after each of my friends tried it after me (both DMT and nitrous) was that both of their first signs of life was a laugh. I heard a small heh come out of each of their mouths when they started coming back, but I had no type of laughter. I being the most experienced with DMT out of all of them, used to find my smaller doses funny, but I found this particular trip to be rather enlightening... I am eager to go back to the other side, but wont do it for a while. I think we are going to do some experimenting with the drug, like listening to certain songs, and they will try out open eyed trips (Ive already done the open eye trip, the closed eye is honestly where its at). The question is, next time, do I go above and beyond 60mg? I guess we will have to wait and see.\n",

The Australian bush, serene and simple, is an ideal place to trip on this beautiful substance, and I wish I could have stayed forever. But there will be another time, already eagerly awaited, to share this experience again with wonderful friends who understand exactly the joy and wonder of opening your mind to the beauty of natural creation.\\r\\n\\nWhat can I call this trip but my final inauguration into the world of psychedelics? Ive had a rocky start on this journey, bad trips and major let-downs that have filled my mind with doubt and anxiety. Now I feel LSD has taught me the fundamental rules of psychonautics, the same lessons more experienced psychonauts have tried to instil in me, only this time, the sheer power of those hours under the night sky broke through my stubborn expectations and showed me. As they say: life-changing.\\r\\n\\nFirst, a little background. I started out with dextromethorphan, but discontinued after a third plateau trip that left me feeling like a broken soul who didnt really exist. I then moved on to mushrooms, starting with a two gram trip of a potent species, and it all went well enough until I encountered something so horrific, it shattered my resolve to use hallucinogens as tools for self-discovery, and had me traumatised for a week. In the wake of the four worst hours of my life, I spent the next two months piecing together just what had gone so, so wrong. Did I have some neurological disorder that prevents me from having an experience that isnt an acute psychotic episode? If I continued dabbling with these substances, would I lose my mind for good? If not for my desperate need for answers, I would have walked away at that point, and I often felt a wiser person would have done just that.\\r\\n\\nBear with me as I describe this nightmare of a bad trip. Imagine yourself walking about, ruminating on ever more confused and less sane philosophy about being God, when suddenly, all your senses warp into a confused mess. Everything you see, hear and feel no longer makes the slightest sense, as your room transforms into a mesh of colours and you lose the ability to distinguish sound and touch from emotion and thought. It is to find yourself catapulted out of this human existence into some other place where nothing is solid, there is no time, sanity dissolves, and amid the absolute disorientation there is only one clear thought: Oh. Fuck.\\r\\n\\nI have just fucked up my life.\\r\\n\\nIts impossible to say how long this lasted, perhaps a minute, perhaps an hour. The only awareness I had of the outside world was that it must still be there, and that my friends and family must be so horrified that I destroyed my mind on drugs. As it began to clear, and the connections between percept and concept re-established, I looked around the room with only slightly less confusion. What was this place, who was I, what was I? I had no idea. I spent the rest of the trip gradually working through the confusion to find myself again. I awoke next morning to severe depression and a conviction that I would never, ever touch drugs again.\\r\\n\\nThe night had been so confusing that it was only when I took acid two months later that I remembered this disconnect between my perceptions and my ability to interpret, the dissolution of boundary between thought and senses. All I had was vague memories of a hellish experience that felt like serious brain damage. But acid has a unique way of enhancing my imagination, and now that I understand just what happened, Ive come to know it as the Blur.\\r\\n\\nI tried san pedro, only to find the specimen was inactive. I tried weed for the first time at four hits, and it triggered a minor flashback of the Blur, which I no better understood, but it left me feeling that continuing hallucinogen use would be a sure one-way ticket to that psychotic state. But at the urging of experienced psychonauts, I gave it one more shot and dropped half a tab of acid. The result was a beautiful night of euphoria and clear-headedness Ive never known before, a brilliant mental stimulant for an introspective mind. I still harboured anxiety that a full tab might tip me over the edge, but resolved to try it anyway.\\r\\n\\nNow, set and setting. I drove several hours out of the city with two friends, M and G, to a campsite where wed spend the next three days. It was M, a tripper seasoned with four decades of substance use, much of it at this very site, who supplied the acid. G, who sampled ecstasy and was currently enjoying pot every day, only had one psychedelic experience to his name, and it was on LSD some six years earlier. Hed taken two tabs and ended up in a mental ward for the next few months. G is the most genuinely happy and accepting person Ive ever had the pleasure of knowing, and as an enthusiast of consciousness study, he felt ready to give it another try with good company and a beautiful environment. So it was that we set up camp, spent Friday acquainting ourselves with the sunlit groves and acacia fields, the crystalline river and the tens of thousands of datura plants lining its bank. By Saturday, I felt relaxed and peaceful, and ready to plunge into my first full-blown, not-horrible, psychedelic experience.\\r\\n\\nWe dropped the tabs at 3p.m. on Saturday. M felt it would be best to start late afternoon, as the night ambience and starlight is beautiful on acid. We both took one tab, while G took a half. Theres no way to be sure, but I estimate their strength at 80µg, and though Im interested in heavy experiences down the road, I dont see myself ever taking this particular substance at more than 120µg, nor using it more than once a year. Beautiful though it was, I also think I may be one of those rare people who appreciates low-dose acid, perhaps in conjunction with another substance, for its unobtrusive consciousness expansion and creative mindset. On this night, though, the one tab was perfect.\\r\\n\\nAs we started feeling the effects, we left the campsite and took a walk off-road into the sunburnt gullies and the hills abundant with kangaroos. Some describe the acid come-up as hard and pushy, but I think its wonderful. I soon had a big smile on my face and not a care in the world. The LSD was tweaking my consciousness and we were laughing at the stupidest things, yet my thoughts became crisp, unburdened. And then less than an hour in, something happened that almost derailed the experience.\\r\\n\\nI was looking at the dirt as I walked... and I had an experiential flash of another state of mind that made me think... What if, as Im walking along, everything I see, hear, taste and smell, and all of my thoughts and feelings, blur into a total incoherent mesh? ... Oh, shit. Thats exactly what happened on shrooms, isnt it.\\r\\n\\nIn an instant, my euphoria was gone. I was starting to get very worried. LSD truly gives me amazing imaginative power, and I couldnt help but imagine exactly what it would be like if the Blur struck right then. It would propel me into a state of total schizophrenia. I would be walking alongside my friends and reality would just disintegrate, and that would be the end. I might never recover. I might be trapped in that other world, that horrible Blur, forever. And thats the price I pay for taking too much LSD  those people who encouraged me to go for it were wrong, this really is going to destroy my mind.\\r\\n\\nI was shaken. Simply by imagining it, I seemed to be invoking the fucking thing, just by the sheer vivid power of my imagination.\\r\\n\\nMy friends knew my history. I could never in good conscience trip with people and not tell them Id had less than stellar experiences with psychedelics. But I kept my mouth shut and resolved to get through this alone. If I told them something was wrong, their carefree air might turn to concern, and that would only make things worse. Besides, if the Blur was going to happen, it would happen, there was no stopping it. I knew I was wavering on the edge of another bad trip just by inviting that doubt into my mind, so I gritted my teeth, anchored myself in reality, and resolved to endure my own anxiety. Acid is such a powerful substance; it only takes one wrong thought pattern to make it all go to hell. I knew this, and Id learnt enough from my previous bad trips to not fall for the tricks my mind was playing on me. So there I was, in limbo between good trip and bad, wrestling to keep it together. Had I taken more, I probably wouldnt have been able.\\r\\n\\nThe sun was almost setting as we made our way back to camp. My main concern by now was whether I actually had any control over whether the trip went well or not. After all, I pondered, how does this work, exactly? People take acid with good set and setting, and sometimes it goes wrong anyway  is that a random chemical fluctuation, or do they just give in to scary thoughts like the ones Im having? Am I in control here? I parted from M and G, who I later found out were wrestling their own demons, and laid down in the grass to focus my attention on the river and calm down.\\r\\n\\nThis was where I got my first visuals. The cliff face across the water began to morph. The longer I stared at it, the more it twisted. It was a subtle, slow process, and as soon as I looked away, it became solid again. I looked up at the trees above the cliff face, and the entire hillside they rested on started bending, so it looked like the landscape was bowing to me. Quite different from mushroom visuals, which are more electrical and remind me of Alex Greys artwork. What they share in common is that the transformation goes deeper the more you stare at the object.\\r\\n\\nI remained nervous and my anxiety seemed to permeate the air, like a presence in the valley. For the next while, I felt that whatever I was doing, I really ought to be doing something else to get a grip, before this anxiety became the dark and terrifying presence of a bad LSD trip. I thought chatting with my friends might work, but found it stressful to keep a happy composure around them. I found being too far away from them didnt help either, because Id be on my own and might get lost if things went bad. Youd think the middle ground of being in their vicinity would work, but it didnt. So what saved me? Laughter.\\r\\n\\nI was sitting in the caravan, trying to write down trip notes. G was saying how impressed he was that I could write anything at all, because he, on half a tab, couldnt manage more than one word. (Incidentally, everything I wrote was quite coherent and legible, but I soon gave up because there was too much happening and writing by hand is sooo slooow on acid.) Anyway, I was having trouble concentrating on what he was saying, so at one point I nodded and said, Mm... thats right... Excuse me. I need to go outside and watch some rocks morph.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the next five minutes laughing hysterically. The rest of the trip was awesome.\\r\\n\\nIt was far from the last funny thing that happened  indeed, our conversations became a strange mix of philosophy, rating burps out of ten, and the most profound fart humour possible... more philosophy, and puns so bad we had to laugh, or occasionally so great we... had to laugh. I was doing most of the philosophy, and I felt an overwhelming need to share it. LSD is very expressive, for me. On the half tab the week before, Id written seventeen pages of things I felt needed to be said, in three hours. Here, I was saying things like, Solipsism can be practical. Embrace self-centredness, but dont let it absorb you. G thought this was brilliant, and insisted I return to the caravan and write down every such thing I said. Every experience I have, with all the existential subtleties, the nuances of feeling  all of it is so unique and how else could I, God, experience it, than to not know I am immortal? M was there to bring us back to reality, and we spent as much time taking the piss out of ourselves as we did legitimately pontificating, until the two merged into one and I announced: The real Zen master knows that Zen is bullshit.\\r\\n\\nYes, acid is a very thinking drug, and I return to what I said before about low doses. Thirty or forty milligrams would be ideal if you need a lateral solution to a problem.\\r\\n\\nPeriodically, I left the fire wed built to stand alone under the stars. Here, I became melancholy. I thought about my problems, the chronic dissociation in my life that makes it impossible to even want to be part of human civilization. I felt bitter that LSD wasnt helping me find a way to heal that, as Id hoped it might. I thought about death and non-existence, what an incredible waste it is, and how stupid it is that were supposed to find any consolation in one day not experiencing reality. Fuck you, I said to the beautiful face of the Goddess that formed in the sky. She was there everywhere I looked, a serene face of many forms composed of the million stars in the clear night sky. I gave her the finger.\\r\\n\\nLater, I wandered about and reflected on my bad mushroom trip, and how Id felt close to slipping back into it before. What had that all been about? It was the Blur, I realised. At last I could remember just what had happened, how my brain had stopped making sense of my every perception and, not being in any way prepared for it, Id panicked. That trip didnt necessarily have to be a bad one. I just didnt have the experience to handle it. And the reason Id spent the rest of it having a psychotic episode wherein I alternately believed I was God, a patient in a mental hospital, a prisoner in my room for eternity, etc. was because I had no idea what to do with something like that. It had completely thrown me. Theres a knack to this tripping thing, thats why more experienced users can take high-dose DMT and hold it together. \\r\\n\\nWhat was it theyd told me? Whatever happens, dont fight it, you have to ride it out. Id had trouble believing that before. Surely if you dont fight the real psychotic thoughts, thats when you break down and end up in a mental ward, like my friend G on his first time. But now it made sense. Even the ones who do lose it, theyre not still tripping when theyre in hospital. Theyre just insane. There was no danger of the Blur ever lasting for my entire life; I would always come down from it, and the only way lasting damage could occur would be if, indeed, I resisted it, and believed I was losing my mind. Because that is traumatic, and a powerful enough blast of it would be enough to unhinge anyone, the same way watching your lover get tortured, raped and murdered would be enough to send someone over the edge.\\r\\n\\nTherefore, the solution was always to ride it out, and have an anchor. If I find my ego blasted to the four corners of reality, I need only hold on to one thing: This is a trip. It is not real. It will pass. And I could have done that, even during the Blur. But I gave in to the fear that Id just lost my mind for good, which was exactly how it felt, and it had destroyed me.\\r\\n\\nStill, a doubt lingered. How could I be sure about this? And then, I had my answer.\\r\\n\\nI went back to the fireplace, and asked M and G to give me some weed.\\r\\n\\nJust one hit, I said, and explained what I was trying to do. Last time I smoked, it had invoked the Blur in a mild shroom flashback. At the time, I had interpreted it as psychosis. It hadnt been as intense as the full thing, but it was still scary and highly uncomfortable, so I decided never to smoke pot again  basically, I decided to run away from the problem. Now, I was turning volte-face and confronting it. This would be my test. My initiation into the world of tripping. And if I was wrong, I would probably lose my mind.\\r\\n\\nI took a good deep hit, laid back to watch the fire, and waited.\\r\\n\\nMarijuana and acid have wonderful synergy. You feel heavy and incredibly relaxed, yet far from incapacitated. Conversations drift off in a hundred tangents, yet you always come back to what you started with and you never forget what you were saying. The dynamic of our little group was simply perfect, three misfits of varying ages figuring out the meaning of life in our own ways, feeling wed glimpsed enlightenment. It was incredible. Im a lightweight with weed, and the acid seemed to potentiate it, so pretty soon, I was pleasantly stoned. And then, just like I predicted, the Blur crept into the fabric of my consciousness about an hour in.\\r\\n\\nAt first, it was very subtle. I noticed some confusion about the tea I was drinking, how the sensation of warm liquid going down my throat didnt seem to make sense. How could it be happening in space and time when it was just a sensation? Sensations dont have dimension. (Perhaps youve experienced something similar on drugs; if not, you probably wont be able to follow.) Gradually it intensified. Our campfire conversation became a far-away mesh of meaningless percept. Yet I held fast to my goal. I did not panic. Whenever I felt Id gone too far out, I reminded myself I was tripping, and endured it. The dissociation from self and identity, the blurring of the line between thought and the external world, sunk into my consciousness. But the warm glow of acid helped me through it. Everything felt right, even the atemporal, non-spatial stomach cramps I was having. All in all, on Blur scale, it reached a three or a four out of ten, and I was still able to hold conversation despite the powerful dissociation. My last experience on weed might make a five on that scale, and on mushrooms, where everything got obliterated, a ten. I didnt need a five or a ten. This preview of it was enough to know that next time I encounter it, Ill be ready.\\r\\n\\nAnd the weed slowly wore off, and we started coming down from the acid.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the rest of the night until 3a.m. playing music from the caravan, and eating campfire food and chocolate. Music on LSD is not as good as on DXM and definitely not as good as mushrooms, but it still gels with the everything-is-just-right glow of acid. Food, however, is transcendentally awesome. Fruit explodes in your mouth. The texture of dark chocolate cracking apart into sweet chunks, the salty potatoes disintegrating on your tongue with hot butter, the onion and (non-psychedelic) mushrooms rich with oil... perfect. We shared previous experiences on drugs  G insisted I write down my description of DXM: Feeling like youve lost 30 IQ points, and good riddance. We stood under the stars again, and this time the Goddess turned into a vampire goth chick, and we all spotted geometric connections between the brighter stars. Visuals had mostly passed by this point, but we continued to notice how the stars looked like little lanterns hanging a few hundred metres overhead instead of thousands of light years away, and how the tin foil around the potatoes looked like breath-taking crystal skulls, or the heads of a Terminator or Optimus Prime. Finally, M fell asleep, and me and G retired to our tent.\\r\\n\\nUnfortunately, I found it impossible to sleep, and spent the next hour tossing and turning. I was getting faint closed-eye visuals, much like what I picture from a very weak hit of DMT. At first they were slow-moving geometric patterns and shapes, morphing smoothly in dreamlike fashion. But as I got more frustrated, they turned into rotten teeth and hideous dinosaur skeletons. Eventually, I realised that with my last, half-tab experience on acid, what Id interpreted as a hangover had in fact been the trip continuing. That day, Id remained dissociated even the next night at work, and I was still having trippy thoughts and a generally altered perception. This time, Id taken more, so it was stronger. My conclusion: for some reason, I peak normally, but I continue tripping for a long time on acid, perhaps about thirty hours. It was impossible to sleep while tripping, so I woke M up and asked for some Valium. It knocked me out mid-sentence in conversation with G.\\r\\n\\nThe next day was glorious. We wandered the national park and I was in love with everything. All so warm and colourful and orgasmic! I felt proud of my decision to face the Blur and my victory over it, and I was looking ahead to my future psychedelic experiences. I think I will try san pedro next, and then ayahuasca and DMT, if I feel up to the incredible mind-fuck. This had been my best trip so far and certainly I took a lot away from it. I have an enhanced appreciation of life, even though I still struggle with what seems to be a mild form of derealisation disorder, and I have hope now that with the help of psychedelic drugs, Ill one day find the answers Im so desperately looking for. Psychonautics is a legitimate psychospiritual discipline for those who want to use drugs that way, and hopefully one day, society will recognise that. A legitimate path for those who seek self-discovery. Trip on and may you all find the peace I had when I sat before that fire and glimpsed, just for a few hours, perfect contentment.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nFirst, a little background. I am not your typical psychonaut, well, at least not stereotypical. I am a high technology major in University; Id like to consider myself relatively well adjusted, and relatively safe in most of my endeavors. Prior to this experience, I had done no other drug other than ganja, I found the concept of psychoactive substances frightening, and didn&#x27;t consider myself ready for the experience.\\r\\n\\nThis past summer, a good friend who I had lived with in a Dorm that year contacted me about going to a rave, a music festival really. On a sparsely populated island legendary in the area for the open-minded populace, and frequent drug use. I agreed to go, as did three of my other good friends.\\r\\n\\nWe went to this festival, a three day affair, the previous week I had been preparing myself for it, reading all I possibly could about LSD. Bolstered by my newfound knowledge, I arrived to the event, and set up camp. Being as that this was a three day affair, we agreed that we should plan our trip. That night we partied, enjoyed the good music, didnt really sleep, but had a good time. The next morning, we all awoke and started to make preparations, we agreed to eat these little sugar cubes a friend had acquired, liquid locally produced, pack a bag with supplies, and then set off down the beach. We ate the sugar cubes, all joked nervously, packed a bag with water, pot, and a camera and set out. There were four of us, only one had tripped before, we really had no idea what we were in for.\\r\\n\\nAbout 45 minutes later, the rocks started to sparkle. We where walking down the beach, enjoying the beautiful weather, when we started to point out the beauty of the stones, their place, their job, their perfection. At this point, we knew it was starting to kick in.\\r\\n\\nTripping steadily, we ducked into the forest, a likely sheltered wooded path providing the perfect venue in which to experience our newfound expanded perception. I felt truly alive, I had embarked on this trip to try to find something I didnt know I was missing, it quickly became evident that my truth was lying just beyond the horizon.\\r\\n\\nThe forest was beautiful, more beautiful than anything Ive ever seen before in my life. Plants were not just plants... they where an extension of the planets beauty. Bees buzzed with a purpose, not simply diving and weaving aimlessly, but traveling with duty. Realizing most of the plants around us actually stinging nettle (think poison ivy",
       " but Canadian) we returned to the beach, rounding the corner to possibly the most confusing situation we could have.\\r\\n\\nThere stood, on the beach, a cabin. Keep in mind, this is NOT a city. This is a beach that requires 20 minutes of off-road travel to simply reach, electricity ending 30 or 40 kilometers back up the island. And here lies a cabin. Approaching the building warily, I felt like we werent ready for it. Like it was not our place, it was not the right time for this building, however, we entered cautiously. The cabin was furnished, not only with the standard couches, but a television, vcr, and stack of movies, quickly becoming apparent that a generator was required for full operation. Relics of past trips lie all around us. Here a picture, there a stack of beer cans, carved in the wood of the walls lie the reminders of previous adventures. Walking over to a side table, I picked up a curious scrap of paper, yellowed with time, it read:\\r\\n\\nWould you rather step in quicksand?\\r\\nOr spend your entire life\\r\\nAvoiding it\\r\\n\\nThis rang deep. Deeper than three lines should, looking at each other in wonder, we decided that we needed to keep moving. The empty place seemed too large for us, seemed too hard to comprehend. Hoisting our bag of tricks high, we left, staring back at the tiny house, wondering what other secrets it held.\\r\\n\\nBy this time, in the hot sun, we had finished two bottles of water, having no pockets due to shorts; I tied the empty containers to the corners of a bright green bandanna, letting it hang from a belt loop. Suddenly I felt the need to complete it, picking up a stone; I tied a third corner off, a bright red lighter completing the fourth. Holding my creation aloft I placed it upon my friends head, and there he stood dubbed: Captain Acid Hat.\\r\\n\\nOnward Captain Acid Hat and his band ventured, walking down the pristine beach, leaping from rock to rock, enjoying the experience of having our senses unleashed.\\r\\n\\nHere we diverge from pure narrative and into theory. When experiencing such emotions, I pondered, what could possibly cause such a shift in reality? Was Captain Acid Hats amazing adventure simply fantasy? Were we all experiencing random synapses firing that caused the plants to seem so alive, the bees to seem so committed, and the water to sparkle like the light of a thousand suns? Or was it something else, deeper.\\r\\n\\nSpiritual? Unlikely. I am a man of technology, I entertain few delusions of theology, in fact, one of my greatest fears was the possibility of experiencing a spiritual vision, what if Im wrong? What if Im faced with the reality of a Christian theology? How would I deal with my entire worldview being shattered? No, this was more. Spirituality was minor in the world I experienced, where there a god he would be humbled by the beauty present in everyday things.\\r\\n\\nMy theory is this: To assume and assert that our five senses represent the culmination of the universes experience is not only arrogant, but dead wrong. It has frequently been suggested by far smarter men than I that we exist in a tiny bubble of reality, our brains are wired through evolution to handle only so much input, so much feeling. But we take it all in, our eyes see everything, our eyes see radio waves, our eyes see other crossing dimensions, our eyes take in everything that exists, but our brain filters it out.\\r\\n\\nLSD is not a harsh chemical, it is not a brutal taskmaster, forcing me into an altered state of consciousness, its a switch, flicking it opened my mind, and I believe, reduces the filters placed between me and reality. For the first time, when I looked at those sparking rocks, I saw them for what they were, without the muddling filters of my brain blocking it.\\r\\n\\nBut back to the story.\\r\\n\\nRounding another bend, we spied the end of our journey. The beach ended, curved up into a rocky bluff, impossible to climb in our state, but affording an amazing vantage point, shaded as it was by the thick tree cover on the hill. We made camp, opened our bag of tricks, and started to talk. About everything, about life, about our experience, we related it quite strongly to simply being stoned out of our gourds, the lot of us surprised at how gentle it was. Our minds were not addled nor chained, we could think, we could talk, hell, Im sure that given the right motivation we could dance, had we not other, more important things on our minds.\\r\\n\\nPacking a bowl took an hour and a half, but we didnt notice, the slow process of grinding passed between us all, rotating seemingly in an organized pattern. Three members of the group would engage in deep discussion while the fourth would be off on their own, watching the water, or the trees, or the rocks, or the weed, never really becoming detached, simply orbiting, it reminded me a lot of a solar system.\\r\\n\\nWe discussed the note from the cabin, its significance, possible theories for its meaning and the place it was found in. We evolved, we became stronger, and on that beach, sitting in the shade, staring and trying to comprehend a tugboat moving across the strait, I found what I was looking for, the missing piece to my life. To a stranger it is unexplainable, but rest assured, I needed to find it.\\r\\n\\nThe sun rose in the sky, becoming mighty at its zenith, and started to descend as the afternoon wore on. Our shade retreated, becoming brighter and brighter, until our cool perch became hot. We decided it was time to head back to the camp. Walking back to the cabin, I noticed the only downside to the entire weekend, in my eagerness to set out, I had forgotten to apply sunscreen to my left arm, the skin was bright red and obviously sunburned. I took captain acid hat back, drenched it in seawater, and placed it over my arm, tying it tight and keeping the sun off it.\\r\\n\\nWe once again reached the cabin. But now it was different, it wasnt hostile, it was inviting. It had judged us, and finding us worthy, became a happy place to be. It became our cabin, our place of refuge from the sun, we explored it, laughed at its jokes, its quirks, doubling up in hilarity as we discovered the foil packets arranged on the table contained dried magic mushrooms, we left them, had no need of them.\\r\\n\\nWe packed a bowl, and then I stood, looking over to the tv that couldnt possibly turn on, spying a drawing on top of it. It was beautiful, simply patterns in crayon, and on the back. Tripping in the cabin, lots of love, john and Marcy, new years 2006. I realized we needed to leave our mark, looking back at my friends, laughing on the old dusty couch, it came to me:\\r\\n\\nYou will never know what youre seeking\\r\\nUntil you find it.\\r\\n\\n-July 2008\\r\\n\\nPlacing the note down, we smoked a bowl and decided to set back, braving the unforgiving sun once again to arrive home, the music of the stage reached us first, bounced over the water, and we started to see tents again, people. Interacting with humans again was peculiar, I felt enlightened, strengthened.\\r\\n\\nWe discovered (much to our delight) that the beach we tred upon was actually a nude beach, and the tanned flesh of dozens of beauties lounged about, smiling to ourselves we made our way back to our campsite, to bottles of water, and the end to a wonderful experience.\\r\\n\\nLSD Changed my life. It wasnt huge, I didnt drop my major and live in the forest, nor did I freak out and swear it off forever, I simply realized how Id been going about things wrong. I am a changed man due to this wonderful chemical, and a stronger human being from that beach.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nTo say that I have tasted the purity of reason is an understatement. The human mind is certainly a beautiful product of evolution. The world is full of amazing processes and cycles, and to even begin to understand some of these is an incredible experience, one which will surely change my life forever. Like many people before me, I have always been intrigued by the subconscious, that which is the very fabric of our dreams, that which explains our actions to an extreme amount of detail, and of course that which frees us from the everyday worries that we are faced with in this society. And whatever actions I chose to take in the past, it all culminated to a single day, which will forever be imprinted in my head as &#x27;the best goddamn day of my life&#x27;.\\r\\n\\nIt all started one day, when a friend tells me that he is able to obtain a vial containing liquid d-lysergic acid diethylamide or &#x27;LSD&#x27;. This was joyous to me, simply because LSD had provided me with amazing and fun experiences in the past, and this time it could be repeated with LSD in a form that was both pure and potent. Needless to say a few friends and I purchased a bottle, and we each took a total of four drops of this mystical substance.\\r\\n\\nI was not new to psychedelics at this stage of my life, having dabbled in Mushrooms, LSD, Salvia Divinorum and Morning Glory seeds. So it was surprising for me that I had difficulty at the beginning of this voyage in that I did not have any hold over the experience.  This was by far the highest dose of LSD (considering how diluted earlier doses were, in comparison) I have ever taken, and that was quite evident in the initial body load. We made the decision to go somewhere out in nature, after having noticed the amazing visual changes that come with an acid trip in the home we had dropped it in.  Seeing nature has proven to be very successful at &#x27;saving&#x27; the experience in the past. Sure enough, we were still uncomfortably vulnerable to everything around us, but somehow we found solace in our own thoughts. We began debating about various topics, such as what it meant to be human, what it meant to think, and what everything else meant to us. We were surely an odd looking group of people walking in strange ways around a church playground, but this did not bother us all that much.  Near dusk, we sat on a curb, as we talked about life. At this point, everything I knew about the &#x27;self&#x27; began to dissolve.  Slowly but surely, our egos melded into the immense cosmic energy that enveloped us.\\r\\n\\nThe sunset came right as the dissolution of our egos was completed. A spectacle of color blending into air, and air blending into color. Never before had I seen something so moving, so inspiring, so true. I could nearly taste the colors in the sky, needless to say I truly understood The Beatles when they sang about &#x27;marmalade skies&#x27;. It felt as if we had been under the influence of the substance for days, however it was only six in the afternoon, and had only been four hours since we noticed the initial effects of the drug. All of these overwhelming emotions of abiding joy and happiness indicated that we were getting into a lot more than we bargained for, and we were about to find why.\\r\\n\\nThe confusing reactions of the people around us eventually became nothing more than a cue for us to leave said playground. The walk back to the house was surely a fast one, since I have little recollection of it, surely it was unimportant compared to other events that happened that day. We arrived and we put on some music and relaxed, still talking about the miracle we had witnessed. At this point it was as if all of our egos were combined into a cloud of consciousness that rested directly on top of us. A person in the group could say something, and that thought would be completely understood by everybody in the group. One could say just one word and everyone would be able to follow a slew of topics and intents behind it.\\r\\n\\nWe had been thinking and talking the whole time, debating some of life&#x27;s greatest mysteries. The house had been painted an intense orange color and the majority of the objects in the bathroom had the same intense color to them. This covered everything and everybody in ever-flowing hues of orange. The air in the room seemed liquid, I could move my hand and it would ripple out the image behind it, leaving trails of my hand in the air. There was about three or four moths inside the room, and their flight patterns were quite evident with the semi-viscous liquid properties the room had taken. They seemed to fly in predictable patterns, that of sine and cosine waves super-imposed on each other, it was quite mind-boggling to see this manifest visually before us. Music had taken amazing properties as well, every note resonated with freedom, with idealistic rebellion. One could put a song into geometric shapes in our head, or taste a certain instrument.\\r\\n\\nThe liberation of our senses was at its peak, and we quickly concluded we were children, seeking the best of tastes, the most intense colors, the most comfortable sensations. My friend had developed an affinity to a penny, he then misplaced this penny, and I gave him a different penny to be the place-holder for his new-found friend. This attempt was of course deemed unacceptable, not even a quarter would be suffice. This was by far one of the most abstract interactions I have had with this person, I truly could not figure out what made that certain penny so valuable, and neither could he. We were truly immersed in a playground for perception. The walls would breathe, the lights would pulsate and our minds were free of judgment, we were in pure bliss.\\r\\n\\nAs much fun as we were having playing with our little lava lamp of a house, it was time to go outside again. During a trip, even if one place seems entirely comfortable, I like to go out and explore my surroundings if I can. Stretch myself. The purpose was to see the lights of the city from the top of the south hills in our city, and we made our way there. The world was drowned in obscurity, and the lights of passing cars felt like immense beams of photons to our eyes. We had noticed that most of the people in the neighborhood still had Christmas lights set up, which made our walk very aesthetically pleasing. The hill seemed to continue into infinity, much like the staircase at the top of the castle in Super Mario 64.\\r\\n\\nWe walked and debated philosophical questions, and the more we reasoned, the more we realized the horrors of our own society. We even referred to the unenlightened people as &#x27;the others&#x27;, not in a condescending way, but in the fact that they wouldn&#x27;t understand us just as we didn&#x27;t understand the society they had created for us. Trees with spirals of soft light around them were our companions in our journey to the top of the hill. As time passed, the air was invaded with the densest fog I have ever witnessed, I could truly see the direction of certain sources of light, much like a laser would in a room that has a smoke machine in place. After an eternity of walking and debating, we realized the top of the hill was in private property, this presented us with another problem. Was man really so vain as to claim &#x27;property&#x27; (let alone &#x27;privatize&#x27; it!) of a piece of the earth? Have we really become to attached to possessions as to say that it is okay to keep part of the planet all for oneself? Of course, after asking these questions to ourselves, we trespassed.\\r\\n\\nWe could not see the city lights in any way we managed, the fog was too dense. We were kind of tired, we surely walked over a mile up this hill, and that was on an empty stomach. We could not rest there, however, the ground was wet and the air was cold. All we could simply do, was look up. Just like some sort of divine intervention, the fog cleared, the clouds dissipated, and the moon was revealed. My mind began racing with thoughts, with feelings, with truth. Eternal energy was a concept hard to dismiss at this point, were were truly touched by something else. It was our monolith, our apex of human evolution, we could understand the way the universe worked, the reason for seasons, the direction of air, the ever-fractal nature of the cosmos. We were one, not just with ourselves, but with every object in the universe. With every fabric of our being, was the way of the heavens manifested upon us. We were not simply humans anymore, we concluded, we were enlightened.\\r\\n\\nThe walk back must have been twice as long as the walk there, somehow, we ended up far away from our host house. We managed to walk back, safely, and with extreme peace in our hearts. Once we were away from major streets, and were in a familiar neighborhood, we decided to run. Running was so liberating, we could choose any pattern of movement, and we feel the air in our faces, and it felt fantastic. We ran all the way to the house like children, in complete amazement, in everlasting joy. Time dilation was extremely present. It was as if our new existence was conceived at the consumption of the four drops from heaven, and nine months later, at the top of that hill, we were born. We were born because for the first time in our lives, we were simply us.  We had overridden the set of standards society had implanted in us as children, we had set flight after breaking open the cage of consciousness, we had broken free of our chains and gotten out of the cave that Plato describes in his famous allegory. We were free, and there was nothing the world could do about it.\\r\\n\\nWe spent the remaining part of the experience coming up with ways to change society, and we concluded that the only possible way was to inspire people to break their head open, to destroy this horrible machine from the inside out. As we concluded, war was insecurity, it was fear, it was ignorance, the very aspects that governed everybody in our society, and we decided to fight back. As the night passed on, we went out for one last taste of the outside world, and headed on to a different playground. We arrived, as the dawn turned the clouds in the sky into chocolate. And we absorbed it all, we breathe in, we live, we transcend. We walked back, and a black cat started to follow us. It was as if it knew that we weren&#x27;t going to harm it, I got on my knees to pet the cat. The sound of a purring cat was as beautiful as the sound of a baby&#x27;s laughter, or the wind flowing through the leaves, I cried on the inside. The cat seemed to want to join us inside the house, we decided not to let it become part of our world, we learned to let go, and we closed the door on its innocent eyes, it did not seem to mind.\\r\\n\\nAs we fell in and out of consciousness, it had been roughly twenty hours since the beginning of it all, we smoked a little cannabis to help us go to sleep, as we had to go back to our normal lives in the morning. The learning we did that day, was pure wisdom. The morning came, the room was not liquid, the walls had stop breathing, the lights were back to normal, but we were still simply ourselves.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nThe Year 1999 was the year of my very first &#x27;astro-plane&#x27; LSD experience. I became what many call an &#x27;adventurer of the unknown&#x27;, a &#x27;cliff-rider&#x27;, &#x27;ledge-walker&#x27;. I had experienced perception-shifted inducers before, in small doses, but not to this extent with LSD. Mushrooms, sure, but not with LSD.\\r\\n\\nI knew this girl, who was already graduated, had a kid, but also had a nasty habit with needles. This nasty habit was so strong that it consumed her life. One night she informed me that she had received some interested LSD with pyramids on it. I, as I had been fascinated with perception shifting &#x27;alterations&#x27; for a few years now, was enthralled to aquire these from her. When I asked what it would cost, she said &#x27;Just come out with me tonight on this run, and you can have it for free&#x27;. Well, how was I to turn that down? A visceral, mystical experience that would be &#x27;given&#x27; to me for a little bit of my time?\\r\\n\\nWell, needless to say, where she took me was a stomach-turning affair. Lets just say that needle-fiends, or even worse, needle-fiends that peddle their wares don&#x27;t make for a fun companion, even if it was for only a few hours. It was at about midnight when she finally dropped me off at home. I was very disgusted with her, but kept it to myself, after all I could relate with her (her being a human being and me understanding the lure that freedom, ease of pain and thirst for ultimate knowledge). In my pocket, four hits of LSD wrapped in tin foil. I eagerly raced to my basement bedroom and unwrapped the foil. Four, cleanly cut squares lay before me, each revealing either a full or partial dark blue/black pyramid that bore an eye in the center. Intrigued, I prepared myself for a long journey. Closing my door, getting comfortable and dimming the lights, I put on some ambient music and dosed. \\r\\n\\nAmazing LSD, that is not in droplet form, takes a while to begin. At least in me it does. Of course, the initial muscle weirdness and odd taste begins almost instantly, mostly from the anticipation I believe. I laid in bed and stared up at my popcorn-like ceiling. I had four candles lit, two on the left side of my room, and two on the right side. I had Aphex Twin&#x27;s &#x27;Ambient&#x27; playing softly in the background. At this point, I would like to mention that I still lived with my parents. I was in high school after all. One of the odd things about living at home and having a deep interest in perception-altering things, is that I never knew when my parents might come to check up on me, which is what my father did.\\r\\n\\nIt had been about one hour since I dosed, I was starting to feel the initial effects, when my father opened my door. He wanted to see how I was, he wanted to talk. So we talked. He had no idea what was about to transpire in my bedroom. During our friendly little chat, I could feel a welling deep inside me, pulsating and dancing to the music I had playing in the background. I was staring at the ceiling as I was talking to my father, and I started to notice the odd fractal and flower petal patterns that I always see on LSD. It was beginning. My stomach got the usual &#x27;empty&#x27; feeling I get when the experience kicks off. Its like there is a hole in me, a huge one. But not in a bad way. Maybe it was the feeling of becoming very light, of becoming light itself. This is where I faked being tired so that I could be alone. I knew that in a few minutes, I would not even be able to look into my fathers eyes, I would be in another world.\\r\\n\\nMy room was only lit by candlelight, and my body felt like it was racing faster than sound. The fractal patterns and flower petal shapes spilled onto my breathing walls and my swirling carpet, swaying and slithering around like snakes. I loved this part of the experience. I giggled with glee.  The candles flames danced and created the most wonderful, yet frightful shapes all over my room. I grew antsy and could not lie down any longer, I had to pace around. As I got out of my bed, I felt like I immersed myself in water, in a huge ocean. It was very thick, yet smooth. I could feel pressure on my chest, like waves crashing onto me, and my arms and legs had much difficulty moving around. My whole body tingled and pulsated. I started swaying and sort of dancing in a trance to the ambient music, which turned into shapes inside me. I must have danced like that for a long time, yet only a half an hour had passed.\\r\\n\\nI then decided that I wanted the dark. I blew out the candles, which spilt wax all over the place, and basked in the oddly smelling candle smoke that seemed to fill the darkness. The stereo lights were the only source of illumination, and with it I could see the smoke, as if it was plastic, heavily moving through the air. Once I was immersed in the darkness, I was thrust into another world. A world almost like my bedroom, but vastly different. I got the urge to speak, and I spoke. But every time I said something, it echoed repeatedly, over and over again, like a cycle. I remember feeling that this was very interesting. I must have spoken every word I could muster, just so I could hear it cycle around my room. It was in this precise moment, that I realized that words have power. They are tangible and really heavy things. I watched as my words bounced off of my breathing walls. My words were never harsh, so they bounced lightly and floated through the air. \\r\\n\\nAt this time, the epiphanies and out-of-this-world Deja-vus began. Those realizations of the world, everything in it and my life. My choices, what I needed to do, what I needed to accomplish. Feelings, my feelings, alien feelings surged through me. Visions rattled in front of me. I lost my body and became no-thing, maybe a source of dark light. I floated around my room, which became a grid-like cube. I watched as everything in our known rational world, and everything outside of our rational world was placed somewhere on this grid. I could see it all. I danced around the planets and stars, played with every animal I had ever seen, and bathed in an endless ocean of energy that envigorated me.\\r\\n\\nThe next thing I remember was that I was in/on my bed. I couldn&#x27;t tell because my body was gone still. Something caught my attention, the grid-like world dissolved and I saw a mirror. My bedroom mirror. In its reflection, I could see this teddy bear that a girl had given me, it danced around and spoke to itself. It even made angry, almost menacing faces/gestures at me. I got scared, which made me laugh to myself, and I stuck my tongue out at it and made raspberry sounds. Then, I got this sudden urge to push my face up against my mirror. I wanted to touch this mirror, smell it, pass through it. In its reflection I could see what looked like my bedroom, but it was somehow different. I wanted so badly to stick my arm inside the mirror, but I was taken aback by an image that began to materialize. I saw towering sky scrapers, those found in big cities, toppling, crumbling and being destroyed. I could literally see this right before me, in the mirror. I remember feeling that the world was ending. That humanity was to pay for our disgressions and our harm to all living things that we feel are &#x27;inferior&#x27;. &#x27;This was it&#x27; I felt. It turned around and behind me more building were crumbling, as if massive giants brought to their knees. \\r\\n\\nI saw flying beings swooping down from the blackened sky, doing things I could not see, or things that were so far beyond that I had never seen them before. These were not angels, but dragon-lizard like beings. They looked at me and told me, without words, that they were ancient and far older than anything humans had ever known of. They were not dinosaurs or anything like that. I asked them where they were from, not in words, yet they would not tell me. I sensed that they were deeply linked to Earth somehow. They were not like the dragons from story books, more ancient, and more &#x27;real&#x27;. Terrifying. I thought they wanted to hurt me and I felt massive fear. It was then that my body came back. I felt it weigh me down and slump me onto my bed. The fear welled up so great that I cowered on my bed.\\r\\n\\nI noticed then that the music had changed, I could hear clanging industrial music playing, that of a Nine Inch Nails remix song. I saw the world ending to the beat of this song. Buildings turned to rubble, massive holes punched into the cities, people dying everywhere. Massive pits of dead bodies and skeletons.\\r\\n\\nI could not remember what had happened after that, but my bedroom was back, and I did not feel the fear anymore. I way laying on my stomach, staring at the darkness. The images were still in my head, and I really wanted to know who those lizard-dragon type beings were and what relation they had to earth. Yet, everything dissolved and I was on a new train of feelings. I had discovered my physical body again and began exploring the sensation of my body. I rolled and squirmed around on the carpet, and played with my hands, my hair. I watched the wonderful fractal patterns dance around my room, and in my eyelids. \\r\\n\\nI could tell that the LSD was taking its course. The peaks were done, all that was left was the coming down.\\r\\n\\nAnd this is the part that I dread the most, especially with LSD that is &#x27;dirty&#x27;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this was great LSD, but in terms of purity, it felt like the &#x27;bottom barrel&#x27; left-overs. Strycnine heaven! My body ached, like it had been turned inside out and back in again. My head reeled from twisting visions and flower petal designs that over took my room. This is when I glanced at my alarm clock, which I had forgotten existed (I forgot about time itself), and noticed that I would have to go to school in about 4 hours! I panicked, but then realized that I would come down before then.\\r\\n\\nThe last hours of my experience were of a calm and resting nature. Pretty soon I was tired, worn out, like I had experienced too much in one night. Its a usual feeling after an intense trip. Like I have traversed many worlds in the span of a moment. When the sun was shining and it was about 7am, I got ready for school and tried to eat some cereal. I stared into my bowl, watching the milk and thinking about what I had seen on my journey. I felt like I knew a forbidden secret (a feeling that is most prevalent during my perception-shifting experiences), some hidden knowledge or wisdom that the rest of the world did not. Thats when I realized that those who take perception shifters are walking the path of the shaman. It is the shamans task to explore the unknown, learn the vast secrets of the universe and bring them back to our dimension. \\r\\n\\nThis turned out to be my very first &#x27;intense&#x27; LSD experience, but it would not be the most intense, or my last.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nAfter a very mild and unexciting acid experience about 3 months earlier, I was not expecting anything close to what happened. I had purchased 4 tabs from a friend so that I could take more if 1 tab was not strong enough. I was supposed to meet a friend in a couple of hours and thought I had some time to kill so I found the tabs and took one. \\r\\n\\nAt first, I was watching this asinine TV show about people running into things and acting like idiots. It called Americas Funniest Videos. Normally I would leave the tv on while doing something else, but suddenly this became the funniest thing I had ever seen. I started to laugh my ass off uncontrollably at every video and could not stop even when my roomate came in. One thing that made it very uncomfortable was that I had not warned my roomates beforehand that I had taken acid and found it very difficult to explain once I was on it, so I just kept trying to avoid them, but that was very hard considering how small our apartment is. Also considering I would keep staring at them and smile which they probably found to be very creepy.\\r\\n\\nSo I was watching the television show, still partly in reality, thinking that this acid must be the mild kind without any hallucinations. Then my eyes settled on the fan that was rotating. There was a light source emanating from the center and the colors became like water, swirling and melting from blue to light blue to white. I was surprised that I was hallucinating and stood up and the entire room became wavy and I felt a bit motion sick. I hobbled to the bathroom with my arms out in front of me and looked in the mirror. I could see my face and it was huge. My flesh was sort of moving around, I felt like I was in an illustration like Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. That is actually the best explanation of what everything around me turned into. I then accidently locked myself in the bathroom and did not know how to get out. I did not want to bother my roomates or freak them out so I stayed in the bathroom for what felt like an hour and thought maybe I would have to climb out the window. I tried with the doorknob again and finally it turned and I was back in the room.\\r\\n\\nIn my mind, I thought I was going on a journey, which I guess I was, and started to pack my backpack with the supplies, laptop, camera, pencils, sketchbook, ipod, ipod speaker, jacket and brought it all to my bed. I spread everything out and opened my laptop and started playing Thelonius Monk. It was the most amazingly beautiful music I had ever heard. I sat on my bed and stared out the window at the condominiums across the street and it was so unexplainable beautiful and the lighting was incredible. Prior to this experience I had felt uncreative and uninspired living in New York because of the superficiality, my school, and the city, but at that moment I realized that the creativity and potential was inside me and all of us and I could find wonder in everything if I looked for it. I realize this all sounds incredibly cliche, but I felt so inspired and all these self revelations were coming to me and I was completely happy and at peace with myself and my abilities. I think I stared at the condominiums for about 5 hours. I cannot really remember my thoughts then, but I remember seeing the most beautiful lights and colors and patterns everywhere and the music was amazing. I also remember thinking that I could never go back to my old life again. That this had completely changed my life and I could never go back knowing what I knew now and thought I understood.\\r\\n\\nThen my laptop died and without music it became less pleasurable. I had also turned my phone to silent because I did not think I could handle talking to anyone. The friend I was supposed to meet had called and when I listened to the voicemail, I started to laugh happily and felt his presence with me. I had opened my window and the cold air was coming into my room, but every time I would shiver, waves of euphoria would flow through my body and I would look at the the lightshow and feel incredibly at peace and happy. Then I realized that I had my ipod with me and started playing Comets on Fire. It was the most intense music I had ever listened to. I went from Comets on Fire, to Volcano, to Velvet Underground, to Blue Cheer, to Jefferson Airplane, to the Wipers. I thought they must have all been on acid when they wrote the music, because it was just too perfect.\\r\\n\\nTime was totally random. I took it at 12 pm and the next time I checked my watch it was 5 pm and dark. The darkness totally intensified the available light. I could not get up and turn on the lights in the room, mostly because I became scared of my roomates and was afraid they would call the police for some reason. At the peak of the acid I was scared, and there was no one to console me except myself. I told myself that it was a journey and that it would eventually end, which helped. So I took out my notebook and started to draw with the light from my cellphone. I believe I did this for like 4 hours. Every pen stroke would light up and then go dark.\\r\\n\\nThis made me very happy to draw. Everything I drew felt like some sort of revelation and it felt like anything was possible. I felt so sure and so capable, like I had found the inner artist in myself. I felt like I had realized my potential. I felt like I was underestimating myself previously and wondered how I could not see the wonder in everything. I remember saying to myself &#x27;why did you not realize the blinds before? they are amazing! The highlights and the shadows alone would make a great painting! I&#x27;ve never realized how wonderful the blinds are!&#x27; I pretty much thought shit like this about everything including the dresser.\\r\\n\\nEvery once in a while I would have to get up to go to the bathroom and it was extremely uncomfortable because I did not want to see anyone. I wanted everyone I knew to be with me and experience this new world, and was very sad that they could not see what I was seeing. I was in another universe/dimension and at some point could not distinguish between reality and the trip. I thought the trip had become reality and that I would never go back. Around 10 pm, I was tired, my eyes were tired, and the trip would not end. I sort of wanted it to end, and was uncomfortable because I had been laying in my bed for 10-11 hours at that point without food, water, or any interaction. I could not go outside because of my roomates and did not want to talk to anyone.\\r\\n\\nIt ended around 3 in the morning, and I waited until my roomates were in bed and I went to the bathroom and ate some food and sat on the couch for a while. I then realized that there was writing all over my body and could not remember when or how it got there. One thing that was written was &#x27;The laughing mocks me&#x27;, I have no idea what that means. I also looked at my notebook and it looked like another person had written all over it. I finally went to sleep for about 4 hours and had to wake up at 9 to go to class. I felt totally out of it. I could not interact with anyone, and felt like I was not stable and could not hold anything. I could not really focus on anything and my eyes kept darting from one person to the next. But I felt like a different person. I was totally sure and at peace with myself. I did not wear any makeup or care, because I felt like I had transcended all of that. I realize this sounds very cliche and retarded, but I felt like I could finally see the beauty and potential of every human being. How much potential I had. How limited we all are.\\r\\n\\nI knew though that I could never do acid in my apartment again. I had to do it where there is a bigger space and a canvas set up with art supplies. I would want to do it alone I think, I do not think I could handle someone else tripping out next to me. I couldn&#x27;t do it without music either. Yesterday when I was off of it, but still had some feelings left, I wanted to get back to reality, and never thought I would get back there, but now I am back in reality and I want to experience it again. I probably will do half a tab next time. LSD took me to someplace I could never conceive of and showed me how far I can push my senses. It was a really intense experience, and words can never explain what happened. I did not even try to explain it to anyone afterwards because I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nSome background: \\r\\n\\nHaving read extensively on the web and in lots of other books about every aspect of LSD&#x27;s effects, and also having talked to a lot of people who used it successfully to solve problems and become better people made me more confident in taking it. I had spent a lot of time thinking and learning about what I was taking, why, and what the potential ramifications would be. Had I not done this, I know this first trip wouldve been nowhere near as good as it was, even at the worst moments, and definitely would not have reached the bliss it did. \\r\\n\\nI had wanted to try acid for a very long time. Its probably a good thing that I waited, as I used to have some heavy emotional problems and also lots of self-esteem issues. I had been working on being more positive for a while, but I felt like the setbacks I had been encountering in school had made it difficult. I&#x27;m a first-semester college student who just moved out, and while it&#x27;s only been about 2 months on my own it&#x27;s been a hell of a ride. I had just tried mushrooms a few weeks ago, and while I liked them, I decided I was ready for something more intense. That&#x27;s why when an acquaintance from high school approached me in front of a building on campus and told me he had a tab of acid he would give to me, I damn near cried with happiness. On that day I had pink eye and bronchitis, so I hadn&#x27;t gone to my early class, and I ended up skipping my second class to drive with him to his house and pick up the tab. \\r\\n\\nWe talked about a lot of things on the way and also on the way back: what we planned to do with ourselves in the future, our previous experiences with drugs. When I told him that I had never done acid before, it seemed for a minute like he was considering not giving it to me. He cautioned me quite a bit, warning me that acid was nothing like mushrooms in terms of visuals and mind-fucking. He also informed me that this tab was triple-dipped, which I think may have been a fib. I think instead of this scaring me off, it made me want to eat it immediately. This was around 2:00 in the afternoon. \\r\\n\\nI basically made no attempts at preparation other than lining up a sober sitter and taking a shower. I was cocky and figured that my strength of personality would be enough to keep me safe while I tripped. I wondered if I would be able to put in my eye drops for the pink eye by myself, I wondered if I would know where I was. In retrospect, for all the reverence I give the drug, I wish I had waited for a more special night to take it for the first time. Pink eye + acid make for some really icky sensations and visuals. While I had been told to only take half a tab, I definitely was not going to listen - I wanted to detach myself from reality completely for a while, which I had not been able to do with mushrooms. \\r\\n\\nMy sitter (C.) had some things to attend to, and we agreed that I would take it at 6 and meet her outside my dormitory building. So I decided to go with some guys to pick up some pot and drive around for a while. We ended up sitting in a parking lot for a long time waiting for the guy to show up, and I realized it was 5:30 already. Anxious to take it, I asked the boys how long it would take to kick in, and they all told me it would be about an hour before I felt any effects. I thought &#x27;Oh, hell, it wasn&#x27;t the plan to take it this early, but I won&#x27;t feel anything for an hour anyway.&#x27; I placed the tab under my tongue and then swished it around for a while. I thought it would be a long time until I felt anything.\\r\\n\\nThis was not the case. On the way back to town, smoking a few bowls after the deal had been made, I definitely noticed some strange (but exciting!) things happening. Mostly it was in the way I felt physically - my body sort of felt like a smear on a flat surface, my jaw felt funny. They were playing some sort of weird music that wasn&#x27;t really my taste, but it sounded the way I imagine the jungle does at night. I think at this point, I was not equipped to respond to questions very well. They all wanted to go to a place in the woods by a river, and while I knew C. would be waiting for me back at the campus, they were too tempting - &#x27;Do you want to go back or do you want to frolic in nature for a while?&#x27; \\r\\n\\nIt was sitting on the rocks on the side of the river that I first noticed some different things happening - things looking different, the water sounding so much louder but also so much more musical. I looked to the other side and decided there was a monkey with a sniper rifle sitting in the grass. I think it was actually a log. This was where I learned how important it is to have good people around you while you&#x27;re tripping, too. I had met all the people I was with just two months prior to this. Two of the people I was with have anger and depression problems, and they were unpleasant to look at and talk to - they were primitive, animal-like, croaking and misshapen. \\r\\n\\nClimbing back up the bank to get out of there, I looked at some moss. The tiny plants were growing and squirming, and I had to laugh. Natural things were another highlight of the trip: whether it was the grass, trees, sky, water: it was all so much more interesting and satisfying to look at than artificial things. From there it went downhill for a while. These people, who had not been prepared to baby sit me this night, let me follow them to get some food. We sat around and I realized that I was becoming very uncomfortable. I wouldn&#x27;t allow myself to be negative, and tried to convince myself that I was having fun, but it was nothing amazing. \\r\\n\\nThen I ran into a boy I knew outside the building. K., the guy that had given it to me, had procured it from this other guy, who I&#x27;ll call B. I informed B that I was tripping for the first time, partially thanks to him, and he beamed and told me he was going to take me for a ride. Every time he said the word tripping it seemed so bizarre. He said the word a couple times and I thought about it: what if I wasnt actually tripping? I decided that it was possible that this was all a conspiracy: B. was just a salesman. He mustve given me this little piece of paper because he knew that I wanted to try LSD, and what I was experiencing was just the placebo effect. He wanted me to tell everyone that his acid was good, sell it to everyone, and take over the world from there. This was a scary thought, overwhelming, sad, but I remained composed. It became apparent that this was not the placebo effect when he handed me a light-up egg that changed colors and put on some techno music in his car driving down the highway. It was joyous. I cradled the egg in my hands and thought about it, how it worked, how beautiful it was. B tried talking to me, but was understanding when I found words inadequate. \\r\\n\\nWhen I got back, my other friends invited me to go smoke some more pot with them. I accepted somehow, and we went to a clearing by a bridge. It was there that I started thinking about everything, nothing, and what I was supposed to do with my life. When you think about it, you are the same as the screen you are reading this on, and the chair youre sitting in, the food you eat, the water you drink. Atoms swap electrons, which are moving all the time, and the electrons never touch - everything in the universe is basically made out of the same material, and held together with vibrations. I contemplated this, and tried to wrap my head around it. It was hysterical. \\r\\n\\nWhen we got back to the parking lot, we needed to wait for a bus to take us back to the dorms. Everyone waited at the bus stop while I tried to give my cigarette to the red button on the emergency phone nearby. I got frustrated when it wouldnt accept, and started kicking it. I thought",
       " what stops me from kicking things more often? I have this power as a human being to kick things, why dont I use it? I wondered if freaking out completely was the best and truest way to live life - since everything is basically the same, and also connected, maybe violence would be the best way to stimulate the rest of the universe and other human beings. \\r\\n\\nThen, my friend G. (an experienced tripper) began to talk to me about things, and the thoughts and fragments of thoughts I had been having began to make more sense. He talked to me about enjoying the hell out of things, and about how LSD is so good for contemplation because it makes you like a child, you notice everything more. I think that the best thing that he said was after we encountered a trash can knocked over on the sidewalk",
       " If all destruction was turned into creation, things would be SO COOL. \\r\\n\\nThis was just what I needed. I prepared to better myself the rest of my life: to be calm even when things are disappointing, to be positive. I realized that kicking things whenever I felt like it would make me physically free, but only for a while, and that the best way to be mentally and spiritually free was to help, to create, to love, to learn. I resolved to stop smoking, and while that failed the next day, I did a great job at cutting back. Until that day, I had smoked cigarettes every day since I was 12 and smoked roughly a pack a day since I turned 18. Since then, I have smoked about 4 cigarettes total, and its getting easier to envision my life without them. \\r\\n\\nI had felt lonely at college, but watching people follow me and try to take care of me, offer me their beds to sleep in and their words to soothe me was the most amazing thing once I realized it. I saw that while maybe Im not bosom-buddy close to anyone in this college environment yet, they have love in their hearts for me and I just have to be there and ready to accept it. Talking to him, I felt everything in me settle down, as if everything in me had moved too fast up until that point and that was the source of my nervousness, my bad habits. \\r\\n\\nLSD did make me like a child. I was able to work through the problems Ive had since I was a kid - I was given another chance to grow up. I cant say how long this pervasive sense of relief and perfection will last, but I know that the perspective I gained will help me deal with setbacks in the future much differently and in more constructive ways. I plan on tripping again tomorrow, in the sunshine. This time though, my friends will on the same stuff, I cant wait.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nThis trip is the one that showed me the way.  It has since proven to be but a glimpse of the doorway to enlightenment. The date of experience is February 15, 2005.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nI dosed at 8:00pm.  My mindset going is was incredibly calm.  It was probably due to the amount of time I spent meditating in the last 4 months prior to the experience.  Anyways, after dosing, I got into bed and just lay there.  Complete silence.  It was the first time I have ever tried tripping in complete, silent darkness.  About 15 minutes in I started feeling the initial mind whirl that I always get coming up on acid.  I felt incredibly drawn into everything.  By now I had turned on the light and was vividly staring at a stopwatch that I had been using.    Things continued on, and I called up to my buddy via the 2 way radio, just to say &#x27;What&#x27;s up&#x27;.  At this point, I felt incredibly light, like my skin was evaporating into the air.  At that same moment, I said to myself &#x27;Here we go&#x27; for I knew what lay just beyond the hour.  \\r\\n\\nI as I continued to lay in my bed, (t+ 0:30) I got incredibly bored just sitting there, so I said &#x27;Fuck it, I&#x27;m gettin&#x27; up.  By now, I was totally feeling the effects of this &#x27;wondrous molecule&#x27; as I so eloquently put it in my inebriated state.  I got out of bed, turned on my main overhead light, and looked at the amazing display I had created for this very purpose.   The room was covered in multiple pattern sheets.  I hung them like drapes from the ceiling, boxing off an area with my bookshelves, and weight set (which I covered with its own blanket, a Canadian flag with a pot leaf replacing the traditional maple), which became a cool area in of itself.  \\r\\n\\nAnyway, back to the room, I covered everything with blankets and floral sheets: the floor, my dresser, everything except my nightstand.  On top of my dresser, I had some really cool looking plants, which really looked like fractals even when sober. It was the coolest looking room I have ever seen.  My bed was a haven of blankets and pillows.  I was in heaven at this point.  Just taking it all in.\\r\\n\\nI started feeling a little anxious as I approached the hour and a half mark.  Now this is just a rough estimate of what time it could have been.  I removed all source of time, except for that of my stopwatch, which I had conveniently placed out of sight.  I remembered all my previous acid trips, but not just those, Theres this feeling, that, like, Ive done this a million times before",
       " an infinite number of times before which gave me a sense of great calm.   I felt connected with a force far greater than that of which my mind could conceive.  Then it hit me.  To truly know it, is not to know it",
       " \\r\\n\\nI had to play guitar.  I came out of my room, turned everything on, and just wailed!  I have a looper that I can record a progression, then I just jam over it.  As I continued to play, I looked up at this poster of Jimi Hendrix, and it looked like he was smiling and nodding his head at me.  It made me shiver.  I was playing exactly what came into my head without any effort.  My fingers could fly up and down the neck, at speeds I couldnt comprehend sober.  Any note, melody, chord, or sound could be produced at will.  I merged what I was thinking, with what I was sensing, and I was the sound.  I became the vibrations in space that created this, like one big ass Super-string (for those familiar with the string theory in quantum physics).\\r\\n\\nI remember at one point, I could see the fields of sound coming out of the amp.  Each frequency was seen as a different color, and I could change the note feeding back by simply moving my finger, and walking into another field of visual sound.  These fields were everywhere, a beauty beyond compare.  It was like a massive collage of sound, layering infinitely on top of each other.  I played for a little while longer, then, just like that, felt it was time to stop.  I put the guitar down, powered off, gave a nod to my Hendrix poster, then proceeded back into my room.   \\r\\n\\nThat is when I disappeared.  I felt this wave of energy flowing through me, it was the eternal life force that is all consciousness.  There was an immediate connection to all beings, I was now simply a letter to identify my body.  It had no connection to my true self.  At this point, there was no difference to what I was seeing with my eyes open, vs. closed.  So I decided to head upstairs to converse with my buddy.  In previous trips, where I have encountered non-tripping people, it really brings me back to reality, but for some reason, he was just as much a part of the trip as the plants, or the wall for example. \\r\\n\\nIt&#x27;s funny, when I hear this, I feel that all of a sudden, Im everybody thats going to hear this, and also the voice speaking it, AT THE EXACT SAME TIME!\\r\\n\\nMy buddy had a fire lit, which I found quite amazing.  I kept staring into the fire, and I would become the fire.  I am sure a lot of you know what I am talking about.\\r\\n\\nAs time went on, I saw vision after vision, just constantly flowing.  I knew I was totally emerged in the experience at this point, and just started walking around slowly, contemplating life and existence.  I got this vision of a graph.  I related the graph to awareness being brought into nothingness, or the zero point.  Then I started attaching words to this, and BOOM, it hit me.  When I analyzed my experience I would always start spinning in my head, pure chaos at its finest.  But when I just felt my experience, not attaching any thought, opinion, idea, or any other construct of the rationalizing human mind, I became everything and nothing at the exact same moment.  There was no experience to be felt, for I was the experience, and to feel it, would imply knowing I was feeling it, and knowing is a function of the human brain.  I became the same as everything around me.   I simply did not exist.  \\r\\n\\nI am the wave",
       " I felt that everything was flowing, moving, and eternally changing and I was part of it all.  Every time I gained self-awareness, it simply felt like I was me, coasting on a wave, which would instantly cast me back into the realm of nothingness.  I wondered around in this ego-less state for what seemed like hours.  At one point I remember thinking that it must have been at least 8 hours into the trip, but upon further inspection,\\r\\n\\nIt&#x27;s only quarter to twelve!  Holy Shit!\\r\\n\\nI figured Id better get back downstairs.  I headed downstairs, and lay in bed for a minute or two, but I was far to energized to stay there.  I got out and began just wandering around.  I went upstairs, and just started walking around my house, in a constant circle.  Through my living room, then past the kitchen table, into the hallway, past the bathroom, back into the living room.  I did all this incredibly slowly.  Taking about 5 minutes to make one rotation.  Once I had been around about 10 times, I realized that I was just walking and observing, which instantly reminded me of my Zen practice, and Kinhin (walking meditation).  As I continued to walk around, I recognized the fact that there was no internal dialogue.  If there was, I was not aware of it.  I was just one big antenna, receiving every bit of information at the exact same moment in time.  RIGHT NOW!\\r\\n\\nIts all sensation, just, sensation. Just feel. Dont analyze the feelings, just feel.  Thats it.  Anything else is just purely",
       " itself.   Feel",
       "Sensation cannot be expressed in any way shape or form.  It can only be perceived",
       "\\r\\n\\nI dont know when I said this. It was sometime during my kinhin practice.  I continued doing this for quite sometime, not sure how long though.  But at least another hour.  I have no idea, I cant really remember much about the next few hours, other than incredible feelings of my own omnipresence.  Details are lost.  But the sensation I remember, was this ultimate calm.  Everything was perfect.  It was the most blissful experience of my life.  \\r\\n\\nZen is the practice of everything and nothingness, being sensation, yet being beyond sensation",
       " I understand.  Some would call this enlightenment.  Others would just call it words.  Beautiful",
       "  Zen practice, is Zen practice.  It is after all, a practice.  Its not about understanding",
       " Understanding is great and all, but understanding is something that we apply to it. You cannot know, to know is to not know. It goes beyond the sense of wonder, because the sense of wonder in itself, is just that. A sense of wonder and to apply anything to a sense, is the mind at work.\\r\\n\\nThere was a point, where I could perceive an infinite number of dimensions.  Both spatial and temporal.  Like for every single perceiving being in the universe, there was another dimension of existence, and I was aware of all of them.  I remember seeing all this again relating to a graph.  It was like a cube.  But there was also a vision of time as a spatial dimension, constantly unfolding to reveal a more, different reality.  I remember seeing fractals everywhere as well.  Everything was a fractal.  Time, was a fractal.  It didnt matter what I looked at, it would become a fractal.  \\r\\n\\nThe last thing I have recorded is All those shit meanings, that don&#x27;t mean shit I have no clue to what I was referring to, but I figured it necessary to get down.  Ah well.  The rest of the night is a big blur of events.  I remember dicing up some gingerroot and making some ginger tea, and I dont know what else happened.  I remember after my buddy had gone to bed, I was sitting upstairs, this was like 10:00 am now, and I just kept smoking joint after joint, but due to the nature of my trip, I just couldnt reclaim my ego.  For I felt doing so would be ignorant.  Then I smoked a joint, and realized that I am in fact a separate physical being (for now anyway) and that life is about feeling, interacting, and most importantly of all, loving.  Every moment, just love.  Not any one or any thing, but just for the sake of love in itself.    \\r\\n\\nThere was not one difficult moment.  Every time something unpleasant would come up, Instead of trying to drop it, I just marveled at the fact that this was going on.  I remained selfless for who knows how long, because I remember waking up, in my own bed, like I had actually taken the time to get ready to sleep.  I have no recollection of this whatsoever, just that I finally regained my ego after waking up.  The last time I do remember (probably right before I went to bed) is 8:00pm Thursday, exactly 24 hours after dosing.  I had no concept of it being Thursday however, I simply know it didnt just disappear.\\r\\n\\nI woke up at 4:00am Friday morning, got out of bed, and realized that I was back.  I rolled up a joint, threw on I Robot which I thought would be the perfect movie for right then, and it was, it put me in a massively introspective mode.  I cooked up some burritos, then chilled.  I watched another movie (Cellular, horrible IMHO) and went back to bed at 9:00am or so.  I got up again at 2:00pm Friday, smoked a joint, and thought to myself, Where the hell did Thursday go?  I remember Wednesday, and then waking up on Friday morning, but Thursday is nowhere to be found.  I gave a little chuckle, and with a flick of my lighter, lit up another joint.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Don&#x27;t do it!] \\n\\nIn the car, I feel like Im perfectly normal again, until we hit the tunnel to route 76. As soon as we enter it, it stretches to an immeasurable length and everything looks like a racing video game. Like Need for speed underground. The car itself stretches and proceeds to extend outside of the confines of space and time. Spaces between cars are also immeasurable and I keep asking Brad how he drives on this drug. He tells me &#x27;experience&#x27;, and I&#x27;m forced to believe him just so that I dont get too scared.\\n\\nWhen I get home, I go directly to my room and turn on the TV, and watch camp lazlo, which is, on this particular occasion, the BEST cartoon I&#x27;ve ever seen. The storylines are simple to follow and I like that, because I can totally understand them. I look at my posters. The Beatles&#x27; faces twist and distort. My poster of a cat hanging from a rope with the caption &#x27;Oh Shit!&#x27; is unbelievably amazing. The cat keeps decaying away like a rotting carcass before my eyes, but it isnt scary, its just beautiful for some reason. The Grateful Dead stare down at me from their arm in arm circle (that picture from 1967 where they&#x27;re all standing in a circle looking downward at the camera), and their eyes, particularly Jerry&#x27;s, are like those of animals. I think to myself &#x27;they&#x27;re on acid, too... right there in that picture... they were the KINGs of this drug...&#x27; and smile inside.\\n\\nThe already distorted Alice Cooper Group poster on the adjacent wall distorts and melts even more, becoming even more colorful and bright, and all my drawings take on a new life. I cannot sleep because every time I close my eyes I&#x27;m overwhelmed with that singular sensation again, touch sight sound smell and taste are all one again, so I just sit up and enjoy the last of my trip. At 11 AM I decide to go to my friend Colin&#x27;s house, but Im unsure of driving. Sure enough, its an experience. I have no depth perception or sense of speed, and my speedometer is so unreadable that I can barely comprehend it. Almost 24 hours after eating acid and Im still far gone, and beginning to wonder if Ill ever come back.\\n\\nI get to Colin&#x27;s and we smoke a bit of pot, and all of a sudden, things are &#x27;normal&#x27; again. Or as normal as I can perceive them to be. I begin to accept that I&#x27;ve entered a new reality and that I must adjust to it accordingly. I start to get tired and go back home to sleep, which takes 2 hours of catatonic laying down to finally arrive. I wake up 4 hours later and its all over.\\n\\nWHAT A FUCKIN EXPERIENCE!!&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nWhen I was in the second year of college I got in with a friendly crowd who smoked a lot of dope. They also did other drugs. I had done various drugs before but this was my first candyflip. We did not set out to candyflip, it just happened that those were the drugs we got our hands on that night. I had recently broken up with a very straight laced boyfriend of 2 years and was feeling rangy and exploratory about life in general.\\r\\n\\nMy friend A had gone away to visit some people in his home town and I knew he had stashed a  batch of fairly good acid in his fridge. I was feeling mischievous and I ended up out with two people I had only just met through a mutual friend - we just helped ourselves to the acid. We were &#x27;on a mission&#x27; as we called it.\\r\\n\\nIt was all a bit hedonistic and unthinking, which was good because it set the scene for  a discovery/journey together/ see what happens/no ties kind of trip. We were coming up on the acid but I didn&#x27;t feel like I was tripping and was at that point under the illusion that the acid was having no effect. In fact it was having an effect but it was very clean and subtle so everything just flowed naturally. One of the guys we&#x27;d dropped the acid with took off and left - I don&#x27;t know why and I never stopped to think about it.\\r\\n\\nAnother friend came by and saw that me and my new friend B were tripping and said he had some good MDMA pills. He suggested we try them too to enhance the experience. We walked back to his place to take them - we had taken about four or five paper squares of LSD each and we topped this up with the 1.5 tabs of MDMA. I also smoked some joints but so potent was the LSD/MSDA cocktail that it didn&#x27;t seem to make much difference.\\r\\n\\nAs we walked back through the empty streets to B&#x27;s room, I began to see psychedelic nets and balls floating around. B agreed he could see them too. I was filled with the sense that the world was a benign and interesting place. We were seemingly coming up on both drugs together. \\r\\n\\nWe were both so wasted that night that we had the same CDs on repeat for much of the night as we couldnt get it together to change the CD player. For an hour so other student friends had come in to say hello and smoke but seeing us on a major trip they drifted off leaving us to it. B had this gadget called a mindlab, a device which is like a pair of glasses which have flashing LEDs on them - you close your eyes and plug into a walkman-like machine which plays alpha and beta waves etc. The noises made me feel awful but I discovered that I could sit listening to the music we were playing (it was the 1st Leftfield album and The Orb UFOrb) and put the flashing glasses on and I would drift off into an intense visual inner trip. I have to say the colours and the images were amazingly vivid,  and I felt very emotional from the MDMA. To give an example of the intensity  it was stuff like flying though clouds with intense bright light and the warmth of the sun on my face and Pegasus flying past - yeah, the full &#x27;signs and wonders&#x27; works.\\r\\n\\nThe overriding factor in all this is that all through the night I &#x27;forgot&#x27; I had taken drugs, or did not think &#x27;Oh I am having a drug experience&#x27; - it really seemed that some new place in my soul was opening up which had previously been hidden to me. \\r\\n\\nAfter what seemed like a very long time, I was suddenly plunged headlong into what I consider to be my only REAL trip ever. I was as if I was dreaming a movie or something, but I was IN the movie. I was flying across a seascape as if I was a gull or a sea bird and away in the distance I could see this island. I was thinking - &#x27;This is the real thing- this is the land of the mind&#x27; - I could see the island was densely wooded but it had a beautiful huge building in the middle of it, a white turreted huge palace with gold flags glinting in the breeze. I realised that this was The Library of all Things. Inside the library it was like a cathedral very ornate and worshipful. But to my puzzlement there were no books in the library, only myself as a three year old running about this massive huge building. The realisations I had were that I had to write the books to fill the library (what ever that meant  I now think it meant be responsible for your own destiny) and that I had to rescue that little three  year old girl who&#x27;d been living alone in that huge lonely library with nothing in it. It was a message to me about my life.\\r\\n\\nAll in all it was a good interesting night but there was something thing very profound about the intense trip part of the night. I felt like a missing magical part of myself had been revealed or restored to me. \\r\\n\\nThe reason I wanted to share this experience is because I truly believe that doing that candyflip actually enabled me to open up the tightly locked flood gates and begin resolving issues from my past. I have heard they used to use LSD in the treatment of alcoholics in a similar way. Essentially what came out of that trip was that I was able to tell my mother about my secret childhood abuse by a relative - I told her about it about 2 weeks later. Since then I have had my ups and downs but I am now in a good place - I have had plenty of other experiences with drugs, not all of them good - but I remember that trip so vividly even to this day some 9 years later.\\r\\n\\nWho can say why it happened when it did? Perhaps I was at a crossroads of life? But I tend to think that in fact it just so happened that by happy accident I took the right combination of chemicals at the right time in my life,  in the right setting, so that the profound soul searching other worlds experience of the LSD was buoyed up and given a smooth ride by the emotional flood of love and warmth and well being from the MDMA. \\r\\n\\nI have never regretted that trip.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nOn October 31st of 2005, I dove head first into the world of pure, psychedelic euphoria. To be completely honest, dropping acid was the last thing I would imagine myself doing that day. Here is how things transpired: \\r\\n\\nAt approximately 10:30 PM on October 30th, I decided to get on the bus and go to the apartment some older friends of mine shared. I was granted a key to their place, because they knew they could trust me and didnt want me stranded outside if I showed up when they werent home. When I arrived at approximately 11:15 PM, the place was empty, because they were all still at work. I sat down on the couch thinking of how to kill the few hours I had until they returned. Feeling tired, I plopped my head down and fell asleep.\\r\\n\\nAt approximately 2:30 AM, my three friends returned. I was awakened by the sound of shoes coming up the stairs and keys jangling to open the door. They all greeted me, and we just chatted for a bit. A friend who would not be tripping, we&#x27;ll call him W, retired to his room after awhile. So, I was sitting on the couch in the living room with B and M. Later, a friend T dropped by. So, the four of us sat on the couch in the living room watching Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. A few times in the duration of whatever show we were watching, B and M kept getting up from the couch and running into the bathroom. T and I  could hear their voices from inside. He leaned over to me and asked &#x27;whats going on with them?&#x27;. I replied, &#x27;I dont know...&#x27;. I thought it was just B and M acting like B and M, but I was mistaken. After the third or fourth unexpected run to the bathroom, M sat back down on the couch and said &#x27;Hey... Me and B are on acid right now.&#x27; I replied... &#x27;Oh... hmm... thats sort of odd.&#x27; B was standing across from the couch to my right and added &#x27;Yeah, we would&#x27;ve told you earlier, but we didnt want you to be upset.&#x27; \\r\\n\\nThe hardest drug I had ever used at that time was weed, so I guess they were uncertain about my attitude towards drug use... however, B and M would singlehandedly change my attitude towards drug use in the moments which followed. &#x27;Would you like to try some?&#x27;, B said. I thought about it. My attitude was &#x27;I don&#x27;t have anything else better to do today, so why not embark on a drug trip for the first time. It seems like the right thing to do.&#x27; It was all very nonchalant to me. I told them that I did. B handed me two hits of acid and said &#x27;You understand that nothing is ever going to be the same again, right?&#x27; I chuckled and said &#x27;Yes, but let me think about this one last time.&#x27; She said &#x27;Well, don&#x27;t do too much thinking because all the LSD is going to rub off on your hand.&#x27; &#x27;Oh, alright&#x27;, I said, and decided to pop the piece of blotter paper into my mouth. They also asked T if he wanted to drop. He said &#x27;yes&#x27;, and was quite enthusiastic about it.\\r\\n\\nAfter dropping, the four of us headed to T&#x27;s apartment to wait for the drug to kick in. B and M seemed in awe of everything around them. Me and T&#x27;s trip had not yet begun, so we sort of waited around for something. M asked me if I felt any different. The full effects of LSD had not yet started, but I felt something, like a stirring inside me. Something that let me know that an &#x27;experience&#x27; was in my future. I said &#x27;Yeah, I think I feel something...&#x27;. M said &#x27;okay, we should all go for a walk!&#x27;. So, we left T&#x27;s apartment. \\r\\n\\nAs we walked, I couldnt stop smiling, even though I was rather quiet. I was just waiting for everything to change dramatically. We all walked to Walgreens to pick up some pictures which M had dropped off to be developed a while ago. What an excellent idea that was. B, T and I stood outside of Walgreens and waited for M to return. He returned with a bottle of Sunny Delight, a few cans of Arizone Green Tea and some incredibly beautiful pictures he had taken on his drive from Seattle to Chicago. As we stood looking at these pictures, a man walked up to B and asked if she had a light. As she lit his cigarette, and the man exhaled those grey puffs of smoke, my trip began. \\r\\n\\nThe smoke which left his mouth had incredible depth. I felt as if that smoke would ascend to the sky, and become a cloud, not dissipate and clear from the air. As the cigarette man walked away, the four of us stood outside of Walgreens, gazing at the magnificent pictures M had taken for what seemed like hours. I&#x27;m sure it wasnt more than 10 minutes. M put the pictures into the Walgreens bag and suggested that we do some more walking. \\r\\n\\nAs we walked down Belmont ave., M pulled the Sunny Delight bottle from the bag and asked me &#x27;You want some vitamin C? Its good for the triiiiip!&#x27;. As he spoke these words, thousands of tracers were eminating from his body. This was one of my most vivid memories from the trip. I replied, &#x27;No, I&#x27;m.... alright&#x27; in that confused, disoriented way you would expect someone on a heavy psychedelic to speak. We crossed Belmont ave. , which was not an easy task, seeing as though we were not at a cross walk and it is a very busy street. We made it to the other side, and decided to walk down a side street near the apartment. \\r\\n\\nSince this was autumn, we entered a world of color by venturing down that little side street. Before we came upon some houses and trees, we came upon a large brown building (which looked purple to me). The side of this building seemed to breathe and pulsate, as if it were alive. B said &#x27;hey! do you see that!?&#x27; and pointed towards it. I didnt reply. I was in awe. I was almost unable to speak for some minutes afterwards. We continued down the side street until we came upon a residential portion of it. For a moment, I felt as if I was outside of my body. I could see M, T, B and myself gazing down at the ground to look at all the leaves which had fallen, looking as if we were utterly entranced by everything we had seen, which we were. Things began to take on a cliched &#x27;druggy&#x27; feel at this point, since M, T and B were being so vocal, shouting &#x27;whoa!&#x27; and pointing to a bush or a tree or a fence. As they walked, I felt as if they were dancing around me.\\r\\n\\nI walked next to B, pointed downward and said &#x27;look at the patterns the leaves make on the sidewalk.... look at those.&#x27; It had rained some days before, so the rain had left an outline in the shape of leaves on the sidewalk. I dont think I would&#x27;ve noticed something like this if I was walking down this street on any average day. The drug was now taking over my thought process. We kept walking and came upon a rose bush next to an old apartment building. We stopped and stared at it for a few minutes. The reds and pinks of the roses were overwhelmingly vivid. \\r\\n\\nWe headed back to the apartment, where we began to look at M&#x27;s pictures once again. I grabbed one of them. It was a picture which was taken from the inside of M&#x27;s car while he was driving down a windng highway road. In this photograph, the sky was a cloudy blue/grey. It looked as if a storm was brewing. A blurry road sign, and an out of focus car were in the foreground. I stared at this photograph for what seemed like lifetimes. I couldnt put it down. I stood near the front door with the photograph in my hand for  about 20 minutes. However, I felt as if I had been standing there looking at this photograph for years. W was now awake. He made himself a cup of coffee and infered that we were all tripping. I think he could tell that I was, since I was standing in the corner with a blurry photograph in my hand. He turned to B and said &#x27;getting people hooked on drugs, eh?&#x27;. This didnt make me feel uneasy. I actually smlied when I heard those words. W had many experiences with psychedelics previously and would not have made me feel bad about tripping. \\r\\n\\nAfter a while, me and T decided to grab two of the Arizona Green Tea cans (to keep us hydrated) and go sit on the back porch of the apartment. We talked of how the drug had changed everything, (since it was a first time trip for the both of us). We shared our experiences thus far, but realized that we still had many hours of tripping ahead of us. T went inside to use the bathroom and asked if it was okay to leave me out here alone. I agreed. I still had the photograph in my hand.\\r\\n\\nI started to look at it once again. This time, looking at the photograph was like watching a movie. I saw the out of focus car travel down the winding road. The road sign dissapeared. I was moving along with the car. I was making a journey into realms unknown. As I watched the car inside of the photograph travel down the winding road, I stretched out my arm, so I could get a clear view of the photograph in my hand. I saw the photograph melt, and then reappear in my hand. It was like something out of a Salvador Dali painting. At this point, I experienced what may have ended up being a &#x27;bad trip&#x27;. After viewing the transformation the picture had made inside of my hand, I felt as if I was transforming as well. I dropped the picture and started to stare at the planks of wood which made up the floor of the porch. During this moment, I closed my eyes. I started to feel a rush of pure, unbirdled mania. I felt as if I had gone insane. I felt like I was living the text in an old H.P. Lovecraft paperback. It seemed as though I would transform into some hideous, lycanthropic creature. I waited for the change to come, knowing there was no return from this hideous physical state I would adopt. \\r\\n\\n&#x27;Hey!&#x27;, T said as he stuck his head through the screen door which lead from the apartment to the back porch. &#x27;Are you alright?&#x27;, he added. This terrible mindset had left me and I felt much better. The awful feelings I had dissapeared as soon as I heard T&#x27;s voice. I decided to go back inside. I walked into the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee. When I had finished my coffee, I gazed inside of the cup. I felt as if there were worlds inside of this cup. Tangible worlds that I could dive into. I did not attempt to do so, since I still had some rationality to my thoughts. I set the cup down on the counter and walked over to M and B, who were feeding a slice of balogna to B&#x27;s kitten. This was highly amusing to all of us. Something like watching a cat eat balogna was incredibly hilarious in this state. After we chuckled at B&#x27;s kitten, B, M and myself stared out of the screen door. I remarked on how I was seeing everything in a color scheme which mimicked the Dario Argento film, &#x27;Suspiria&#x27;. This made M and B laugh. In a sense, I think they thought it was &#x27;cute&#x27;, introducing a younger friend of theirs to the psychedelic experience. We stood there in the kitchen for a bit, absorbing the &#x27;life&#x27; that seemed to radiate from everything around us. \\r\\n\\nAfter a few more hours, and as the effects of the LSD were still prevalent, but dwindling, I decided to head home. M, B and T wanted to go get some food at Taco Bell, which was on the way to my bus stop, so we all walked together. We all remarked on what the experience had been like. B and M (who had tripped before) were just dying to know what I thought about the chemical wonderland of LSD. I told them I enjoyed it. As we walked, we kept looking at eachother with odd looks on our faces... because people wearing costumes, masks, make up, etc. were parading all around us. We remembered... today is Halloween. Picking October 31st really hightened my trip. The one day on the calandar where &#x27;anything goes&#x27;, where you think nothing of coating yourself in fake blood and running up to your friends shrieking like a madman in order to say &#x27;hello&#x27;... that was the day I decided to drop acid for the first time. It made perfect sense to me. As M, B and T walked into Taco Bell, we parted ways. They asked if I wanted to come eat with them, but I wasnt very hungry. I felt as if I truly bonded with the three of them. I gave B a hug, and shook hands with M and T, and thanked them for the experience I had that day. \\r\\n\\nAs I stood at the bus stop, I remembered how I hadnt recieved the full effects of music while on LSD. I heard music in the form of sounds from video games people played in the other room and whatever people played from their cars outside, but I craved more. In my bag, I had a portable CD player and my headphones. I put them on. The album I brought with me was &#x27;Blessed Black Wings&#x27; by High On Fire. High On Fire is a band which I would consider one of the &#x27;heaviest&#x27; of all time. I pressed play. I made sure the volume knob was all the way up and the bass boost was switched to &#x27;ON&#x27;. As the first track came blasting from my headphones, the bus pulled up.\\r\\n\\nI suddenly fumbled for the money to put into the fare collection machine, since it was mostly in quarters at the bottoms of my pockets. After paying my fare, I shuffled to the back of the bus and sat down. Here, I abosrbed the crashing, overly-distorted sounds hitting my eardrums at full force. Near the end of the first track, I shifted in my seat and something else in my bag hit the track selection button. I realized this later on, but at the time, I felt as if my CD Player was posessed by some unknown force. Suddenly, it started playing a later track in the album called &#x27;Silver Back&#x27;. As this song met my ears, I felt as if I were listening to elephants stomping around me. Distorted elephants. The bass-laden guitars sounded like thunder. This was an incredible thing. Even though I had an interest in music ever since I was 4 years old, I felt like I never appreciated the power of the recorded sound until now.\\r\\n\\nI listened to the remainder of the album, got off the bus and started to think of what other albums I should listen to. When I arrived home, I went into my basement, where a good stereo system was waiting to greet me. I dug out my copy of De-Loused In the Comatorium by The Mars Volta. I listened to that entire record while coming down from my trip. It was a beautiful experience. I just sat in front of the speakers, absorbing the sounds eminating from them, until the entire album was complete. \\r\\n\\nOnce the album had finished, I noticed I still had my cell phone in my pocket. I felt the need to call someone. I needed to tell someone else about what happened to me. I needed to speak to someone I trusted about the experience. I called my best friend, J. He was more than happy to listen to me. This helped me come to grips with reality, since I was not prepared for the magnitude of this experience. I had little to no knowledge of the effects of LSD, I didnt plan out my trip carefully, I didnt read up on acid before ingesting it for the first time, however, I was in the company of people I trusted, in a very comfortable environment. Hence, my first expereince was nothing short of astounding. After talking with J, I started to feel as if I could actually go to sleep if I tried. However, I needed something to eat. I microwaved a frozen hash brown patty and slathered it in mustard and ketchup. This was amusing to me. I felt as if I couldnt eat a plain, ordinary hash brown patty. It needed to be VIVID and COLORFUL. Yay! As I devoured my hash brown patty, I decided that I needed a movie to fall asleep to. I chose &#x27;Ichi The Killer&#x27;. I popped the DVD in, layed down on my bed, and absorbed the few fading visuals the acid would give me before leaving my system and letting me rest.   \\r\\n\\nAfter my slumber, I was quite willing to return to normalcy the next morning. I saw with a new set of eyes.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nWe meant it to be both a literal and figurative trip, having rented a sprawling compound smack dab in the middle of the desert two hours outside our city. Five of us had set aside the Summer Solstice weekend just for this. \\r\\n\\nA gifted visual artist and craftsman who Ill call Albus was the oldest (post 50, as the French would say) and the most experienced. While the rest of us could only boast of long histories with cannabis, Albus had met Tim Leary, tuned in, turned on, and dropped out. When I invited him on the trip, my motive was obvious. An inexperienced cousin of mine, lets call him Manny, had that year turned one year older than me, 25. In one of Marilyn Monroes immortal lines, Thats a quarter of a century! Makes a girl think. And Manny clearly was thinking. More and more, our conversations began revolving around psychedelics.\\r\\n\\nId told him my story about getting dosed at a party when I was 19 and the terrifying acid trip that followed. Now nearly six years later, I shared with Manny a growing interest in mushrooms, but I couldnt shake the memory of my paralyzing first trip. Then the idea struck: what if my loss could be someone elses gain? \\r\\n\\nWere going to the desert, I promptly informed Manny, Albus, and 2 other close friends; Jimi, a musician whose weekend luggage included his ever present guitar and Wes, a horror movie junkie/astronomy enthusiast who had only recently moved to the city. Everyone with the exception of Albus had little to no psychedelic experience. I had tested, in three varying doses, the Penis Envy strain batch of shrooms we were set to take, but that was it.\\r\\n\\nWe arrived at the desert compound on our chosen Saturday to find a quirky space - private and isolated behind no less than three gates, the rich green grounds peppered with tree houses, fountains, and Greco-Roman statuettes. The delightfully like-minded owner gave us a tour of the property, adding that she grows weed on it before bidding us, a blessed stay.  The next few hours were spent stocking the fridge, unpacking and exploring. At around 5pm, we threw bananas, strawberries, cinnamon, cayenne, avocado, apple, ginger, turmeric, mint, and almond milk into a blender. Oh, and of course, the shrooms! A lot of ingredients, yes, but we were starving; breakfast had consisted of a single bagel followed by juice for lunch, per Terence McKennas recommendation to fast. After drinking the elixir, we jumped into the van. \\r\\n\\nThe initial fight or flight stimulation of the central nervous system made for an eerily quiet, anxiously expectant car ride. Our original plan had been to visit a nearby national park, but the closest entrance proved farther than expected. We sat in silence, feeling the butterflies. Words broke seemingly involuntarily from a stoic Manny (I drank the most the quickest.),  sending us into nervous peels of laughter. Jimi, navigating from the passenger seat made the wise recommendation, Looks like a dead end road close by, with mountains at the edge",
       "Lets just go there. The fact remained unspoken but shared: we werent going to make it all the way to the park. The shrooms were already coming on strong. [Erowid Note: \\nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don&#x27;t do it!] \\n\\nThe dead end road had gorgeous, majestic rolling hills towering at its foot. Wes and I raced up the first, dodging snake holes and cacti. The heat felt like a separate drug unto itself, it hit you so damn hard. Real or imagined, I spied a patch of cloud covered shade at the top of the tallest hill. That combined with the lure of a probably incredible view drew me like a magnet. \\r\\nBy this point, the colors of rocks on the sandy ground had turned unearthly vivid. Mercurial faces blinked up at me, each rock signifying a tiny yet significant piece in the great living puzzle of Mother Earth. My eyes fell on one rock in particular, which looked back at me with a somehow reptilian expression. I stopped dead. Its a snake! No, a rock. The mushroom was playing tricks. \\r\\n\\nI recalled a story from the Arabian Nights about a mountain whose numerous rocks indicated the number of people whod tried to climb it before. Legend had it that if, while climbing the mountain, you turned back or so much as glanced over your shoulder, you turned to stone. Intriguing, but I was more concerned about snakes, which my dilated pupils could no longer distinguish from rocks and sand. I was more concerned about snakes, which my dilated pupils could no longer distinguish from rocks and sand. I called up to Wes, several yards ahead, Hey, man - Ive hit a wall. Tell me how it is up there, though! He put two thumbs up before recommencing the climb. I turned back and did not turn to stone, however, my insides did.\\r\\n\\nThe rolling hills below stretched toward the horizon like gargantuan waves mid-swell, vibrating and pulsing as if each hill was one finger of a giant claw - Atlass claw. In its peculiar, esoteric language, the mushroom had begun its mysterious dialogue. See how powerful the earth is, it seemed to say, see how infinitely mightier, wiser, and more beautiful than any human, a speck of dust by comparison, could ever imagine? Yes, I said aloud to no one in particular.\\r\\n\\nMeanwhile, the members of our trip tribe at the foot of the hill were in less than blissful states. Manny, having succumbed to hunger and broken his fast was bringing up the chicken hed wolfed down with gusto just prior to drinking the smoothie. Albus stayed by his side like a protective, loyal sentry while Jimi more or less hovered in one place, experiencing stronger auditory hallucinations than visual ones. He seemed like an animal focused entirely on listening, his ears perked up and his head jerking around at every little sound. We would later learn that Jimis keen ears picked up on something before either Wes or I had begun to climb: the sound of a flag flapping against a pole. I swear, it sounded like it was coming from the top of that hill, Jimi recounted post-trip, But I thought I was nuts. Every time I looked up, there was nothing there. And yet, unbeknownst to Jimi at the time, something did in fact turn out to be up there.\\r\\n\\nWes had reached the top of the hill in mere minutes. Oh my God, he exclaimed, panic in his voice, Someone died up here! There are flowers and stuff",
       "its really sad.\\r\\n\\nA lump formed in my throat. The word, sad seemed to reverberate around every corner of my soul. Sober, I would have asked detailed questions about whatever makeshift memorial was up there. I might have even scrambled up to see for myself. This time, however, I couldnt speak. Atlass claw still seemed magnificently powerful but less friendly. Dont underestimate me, it seemed to warn, I hold life within, but also death.  Jimis voice from below broke the ringing, revelatory silence: Hey! You know what sounds good? A pool!  The heat really did sting ones skin like a swarm of bees. I passed Jimis message up to Wes, who agreed to depart for the compound. He too had had to turn his attention away from the growing despondency of death and back to the majesty of the mountains.\\r\\n\\nBack in the car and roughly one hour in, the nausea reared its ugly head at me. Though clouds swirled playfully outside, I felt too sick to do anything other than stare at my feet, willing myself not to vomit in my dear old friends clean and faithful van. The ride lasted 20 minutes; millennia in mushroom time.\\r\\n\\nAll of us nearly fell out of the van. Manny and Jimi made beelines for the pool and I for the bathroom. Waves of nausea coincided with my skin appearing to turn yellow and the walls magenta. I had the disorienting sensation of not knowing which way was north or south, east or west, even up or down for that matter. Though queasiness returned in waves throughout the trip, it gave me a reprieve just long enough to teeter out into the living room where Albus and Wes sat on plush couches, commenting on the compounds undeniable quirkiness. \\r\\n\\nEverywhere you looked, Jesus was visible - in pictorial or idol form. So many Jesuss, observed Wes. Yeah, agreed Albus, Theyre scaring the bejesus out of me! Infectious laughter followed more Jesus jokes and word play. Although I laughed too, a sense of vague melancholy threatened to turn into a tidal wave of despair. \\r\\n\\nNoticing my discomfort, Albus took his trip sitter title seriously. He retrieved a surprise from the van - a newly finished drawing he said he hoped I especially would get a kick out of. When he unveiled it, I gasped. Clearly, this beautiful illustration mirrored a photograph Id taken after stumbling upon a solitary chair in a dark, dusty, empty barn one day. It was marvelous, better than the original photo; I really wanted to gaze longer but every object in my vision was breathing, swirling, bulging, and shrinking, the contents of Albuss picture included. The more I stared, the more it moved, and the more I panicked. \\r\\n\\nObeying the urge to change the scenery, I went outside to wander the grounds alone. In a small clearing surrounded by swaying palm trees, I stopped to take a page out of Jimis book and just listen. The wind made the trees go, Ssshhh, like a mother gently hushing a small child. \\r\\n\\nThe mushroom speaks, may be the easiest Terence McKenna quote to remember. His strong recommendation to engage in a dialogue (or at least, try to) spurred my vocal chords into action.\\r\\n\\nYou sound sad, I told the trees, But is it true? Or do I think so because Im sad?\\r\\nDeath popped thematically into my head; I thought not only of Wess discovery on the mountain but of the deadly shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, which had made headlines just days before. I thought of the carnage seen round the world as a result of guns, bombs, and other manmade vehicles of destruction. \\r\\n\\nWe made guns, something prompted me to admit aloud, Humans made machines that kill. It was us. Theres no one else to blame. The ssssshhhhh of the wind grew louder and the trees seemed to sway more forcefully. Something warm glowed in my chest. The plants were responding - not with words, but with feelings. They agreed completely and yet, anger didnt figure into the equation.\\r\\n\\nWhy? I practically yelled, Why arent you angry? Were not just hurting ourselves, were demolishing the rainforests, polluting the atmosphere, raping the earth. Were hurting YOU! My voice trailed off along with my sudden burst of passionate, indignant rage. The trees spoke more clearly than ever, again through feelings, not words. My voice trailed off along with my sudden burst of passionate, indignant rage. The trees spoke more clearly than ever, again through feelings, not words. Their sadness came from pity - pity for any species so hellbent on destruction. Their tranquility came from the understanding that the greatest collective goal is to facilitate life, not end it. Humans, as opposed to other mammals have become artfully cruel in their methods of killing. For this, nature weeps, as a mother would for a son who has made a tragically poor decision, her tears coming from an inner holy place of unbreakable, forever enduring love. In this tender way that afternoon, nature wept for man.\\r\\n\\nMy knees shook as a line from the good old Brothers Karamazov entered my head, Fall down on the earth and water it with your tears. This would have happened had a voice behind me not asked, How are you doing? It was Jimi. Good, I responded, regaining my composure, I was just talking to this tree. He smiled without a hint of deprecation. His experience thus far had been intense as well; only now, three hours in did he finally feel comfortable listening to music. A monumental relief for a musician!\\r\\n\\nWe sat at a table near a big, bubbling fountain. Jimi played the apropos desert rock album, Bright Size Life, from his portable speaker as the sun made its glorious descent across the horizon. Wes soon joined us, Manny appearing shortly thereafter. The splendor of the sunset dazzled our senses. Nature truly was a wonder to behold. So wonderful that now, 5 hours in and decidedly on the comedown, I still wasnt ready to leave the natural world. \\r\\n\\nWes and Manny went back inside while Jimi and I traversed the grounds by the light of the full moon. The sky looked strikingly close, like the oval roof of a planetarium just thirty feet or so above our heads. Jimi reminded me what the compound owner had told us: This propertys on a unique geographical plane. Oftentimes, when a storm moves in, it will only rain here. The neighboring ranches wont get a drop! We stared up at the moon until we had cricks in our necks, then went back inside.\\r\\n\\nA delicious aroma greeted us; Albus was cooking. To my relief, inanimate objects in the cluttered living room had stopped crawling, though the sensation persisted in my periphery. The sight of a clean counter and washed dishes nearly moved me to tears. Albus was more than a trip sitter, he had taken on the role of Papa Bear with pride. Wes and Manny were already chowing down on sausages hed grilled to perfection. A recurring mushroom theme for me seems to be gratitude; on a trip comedown, I feel so grateful for the simple things in life often taken for granted, such as food and drink.\\r\\n\\nAfter our late dinner, for it was after 10pm at this point, the five of us spent the tail end of the trip outside by the big circular fountain where sunset had us spellbound hours earlier. An enormous cloud moved in front of the moon, alternately cutting its light. Wes and Jimi laid on the edge of the fountain, flat on their backs so as to better observe the sky. Albus passed around a pair of binoculars. At some point, he and Manny walked a few yards away to, of all places, the clearing where Id had my dialogue with the trees. The three of us still by the fountain could hear them chatting merrily in the distance. \\r\\n\\nSuddenly I heard a soft pop and hiss just above my head. I looked up in time to see a tiny patch of light fading away in the sky. Had I been alone, I would have called it a hallucination. But Jimi had seen it, and Wes had nearly fallen off the edge of the fountain. It wasnt a shooting star! he cried, But it may have been a meteor. I definitely saw flames! The hallucinations, even the trails/traces had ended a while ago. Whatever final surprise nature had in store for us that day had apparently made its mark even without direct psychedelic aide. We felt truly connected to the earth and our specific place on it - this rambling, eccentric, wacky ranch.\\r\\n\\nThe next morning found me roaming the grounds barefooted after one of the most peaceful sleeps of my life. The sun illuminated what I had not noticed the night before: A Greco-Roman statue of Atlas, painstakingly hoisting the earth, the incredible, animate, living earth high on his mighty shoulders.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\nThis is my experience with shrooms (my first time, about 1.75 g of psilocybin cubenesis, which was about 3 caps and two stems, dried), ecstasy (one red smiley), and cannabis (about three pipe hits of some good purp). Drug history: Smoke weed occasionally, with a consistently low tolerance. Have rolled once before, but the E my first time was not nearly as good as it was this time. Have snorted .5g of cocaine once, and have taken various pills at various times, but not too often. I dont drink almost at all.\\r\\n\\nAt 11:30 PM, I ingested one red smiley ecstasy pill with V. We had not prepared beyond not eating for the last four hours or so (and myself reading reports on shrooms online), and by 12:00 I was feeling pretty alright, just chilling, ready for the come up. At 12:10 AM I began preparing my 1/16th of shrooms, (with strawberry jam on a croissant), and consumed them at about 12:13, just as the ecstasy was starting to hit.\\r\\n\\nI was with my friends V and T",
       "They were just interested in watching my reaction to the psychedelic mixed with MDMA. At 12:25 Im starting to get a slight &#x27;high&#x27; feeling, without the drowsiness that weed causes. Everything is slightly wavy, and by 12:35 Im getting sea legs and definitely coming up on the ecstasy. From then until about 12:50 things start shifting and patterns become clear until about 1 when they are very obvious and seem very real, diamonds on the tiles, chain link fence-like patterns crossing back and forth with some random colors floating in the air as the euphoria grows, and V, T, and I talk about how great this E is and how great we all are and the fun were having.\\r\\n\\nFrom about 1:45 to 2:30 the floor betweens to wave, I realize that my breathing pattern is being mimicked by the walls, and a paint pattern on the floor of my bathroom left over from some remodeling a few months ago becomes 3-dimentional, it raises up like tiny skyscrapers, and the pattern begins to lift off the tile and float. V and I are thinking VERY similar thoughts, and just conversing about great things like water polo stories and our friendships. The grout on the tiles is waving and twisting, and the tiles shift between a small city that is surrounding me and a glass ceiling, through which I see a forest, covered in snow, with a dragon or wolf running through and moving. Conversation is still completely recognizable, I am still legible, and I am recognizing a stronger aura in the bathroom than in my room, where there is too much to concentrate on. V, your face is argyle. I am having lots of fun talking to V about what Im seeing and about how awesome everything is. V and I talk deeply about how all religions are very similar and how afterlife depends more upon a persons actions and way of life than strict religious beliefs.\\r\\n\\nFrom 2:30 to 3:00 I spend the time laying down in my bathroom as the ceiling extends to infinity and I am under the impression that I am speaking directly to God, I see a light and cry in happiness (both due to my experience and some kickass ecstasy). I talk about God with V and I begin to see exactly what hes saying as images on walls or shifts in reality. I am suddenly struck with huge amounts for respect for this drug as V and I realize that there are no boundaries to our feelings or conversation, and how much life restrains us. The euphoria is extremely powerful and I bring up the idea of both shrooms and E being birth drugs, and I finally understand the concept. Every few minutes I live a lifetime somewhere else, complete with setting and dialogue in my head. Patterns are lifting off their objects and floating as I am becoming very disoriented, and my legs feel very shaky. At about this time my vision triples, and stays tripled for a couple hours.\\r\\n\\nAt about 3:05 we leave my bathroom to the backyard to smoke a joint with some really good bud in it. I walk outside and my backyard is completely foreign to me  there are only three lights, as everything else is pitch black. I almost fall in the pool, but all the visuals are gone, nothing but darkness envelops me for 20 minutes until my eyes get adjusted to the light. We sit down on the pool deck, and my legs are less stable than ever. I have no recollection of distance or space of the outside world. I look up and see the stars connect and become a huge waving web, and once again I am convinced that God is watching me specifically and showing me how things really look like beyond normal human perception.\\r\\n\\nAfter my first hit the visuals return strongly, but the combination of the darkness and a new setting make for a worse experience than previously, Vs face starts melting (hes been talking the whole time about how beautiful the night is) and I see his face stretched and contorted in really freaky ways for about 5 minutes. I zone out and just look, not understanding what hes saying, only looking at and thinking about how grotesque he looks. This is when the visuals are at their clearest  oranges in my lap, slinkies going down endless stairs on the grass, bursts of light and movement all around my face",
       "Only when the lighter is re-lit to provide some light do I realize that V does not, in fact, have dreadlocks and a very large mouth, nor is he yelling at me. \\r\\n\\nSuddenly, a constant refresh period begins, one that continues for about the next two-three hours. This is probably the craziest and most disturbing of the mushrooms effects. What happens is that every 5-30 seconds, everything suddenly becomes normal and in a split second I re-learn where I am, who I am, what Im on, and everything thats been going on over the night. However, immediately after this rebirth of my mind, everything I see suddenly goes back to shit and the shrooms grab hold of my brain once again, faces melt, patterns lift off their objects and move, the pool water is spinning, and the moon is shivering as I re-enter my bathroom with V and T. Nothing stayed constant. Everything would stabilize suddenly, and then go back to insane. Breathing seemed strange only because everything that I am seeing is breathing with me.\\r\\n\\nAt about 4:10 T decides to sleep, so he leaves. V and I discuss random things and I feel like my focus is getting better as my high seems to be starting to wear off, and V and I start to feel like one again",
       " until we get into bed. V passes out after he talks about how amazing moving your legs around in the bed feels, and how he was orgasming from every pore in his body, truly, it felt like an orgasm (this is about when the walls started orgasming as well  an interesting effect). I was still talking, seemingly to myself, until about 5 when I passed out. By the time I passed out, I was convinced I visited hell when I refreshed only to remember nothing of what Im on, I recognized who I was and who was next to me, but my room seemed totally different, nothing was recognizable, everything was shivering or waving, things were floating and images were trailing, and I couldnt stop moving for some reason. This happened about twice before 5, and about twice after 6 when I woke back up",
       " to find myself still fucked up.\\r\\n\\nThe experience from about 4:30-6:45 was the closest I can say I have gotten to insanity. This was about the time I told myself that the trip went too long. I can honestly say that forgetting after a refresh is one of the scariest things I have ever experienced. I call it hell to myself, simply because of the extremely disturbing level of uncertainty that refused to go away, and the agitation and anxiety that came with it for some reason. Think about the cold sweat and crazy hard heart pounding you get when you get caught doing something you shouldnt be, or when you miss the bus, and multiply it by about 10. It didnt help that there were faces in my comforter and on the ceiling. I can usually adjust well, but apparently the shrooms refused to let my reason into the room with me.\\r\\n\\nTime from 6-8 became nothing - I felt like I joined the flow of creation, such that I was dying, living, and being reborn constantly. An hour felt like a minute, and ten minutes felt like hours. The stretching of time was the trippiest part of the end of the experience, especially when time normalized at about 7:30-8:00 when I came down off the shrooms fast and hard. From 8 to about 2 PM that day I was drowsy and sometimes disoriented, but all the other effects were gone.\\r\\n\\nI would not consider this a bad trip. The E made the first few hours absolutely amazing, when it wore off and the shrooms really did their thing, however, it was enlightening. I spoke to God, cried, and went to hell, but I learned so much about myself and the true power of drugs. I have an extremely powerful respect for shrooms that no other drug has yet instilled in me. The hellish experiences made me figure out some limits and helped me understand some things about myself. I dont know if Id ever do them again",
       " if I did, I wouldnt want to be the only one on them. Itll probably be a while, and more for an enlightening experience than a fun one. Admittedly",
       " they were crazy as hell",

I took 1 gram at about 11pm and lay with my girlfriend watching the stars.  She became tired and went to bed after an hour.  I took another 2 grams and went for a walk.  I set off at midnight alone on a rural county road.  There is very little light pollution, the sky was clear and the moon was full.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better conditions.\\r\\n\\nAt first I felt some minor dizzyness, probably as much from tiredness as from the mushrooms.  I was walking easily, enjoying the feeling of floating and numbness in my legs.  Every minute or so a car would cruise past on the highway a mile away and these sounds only added to my feeling of peace and seclusion.  \\r\\n\\nWithout any warning, a burst of static assaulted me.  It was a sensation that reminded me of touching a live 110V wire. Without any warning, a burst of static assaulted me.  It was a sensation that reminded me of touching a live 110V wire.  For half a second, I was blinded and deafened by this burst.  It made me stumble a bit.\\r\\n\\nAfter that first burst of static (these happen to me every time I eat mushrooms), the sky began to look very beautiful and I looked up as I walked.  I began to run, which felt like flying.  I couldn&#x27;t feel my legs, but I could run as fast as ever and the wind rushing past my ears was exhilerating.  When I started to lose my breath, I slowed to walk.  I was approaching some irrigators in a corn field and I had to time it and run a bit more so that I wouldn&#x27;t get sprayed.\\r\\n\\nI turned around at the end of the road and headed back home.  After a minute, I took my shoes off and walked barefoot.  After another minute, what the hell, I took my clothes off and walked naked for a half mile or so, while constantly checking behind me for approaching cars.  It felt good to walk naked; I was cold when I began my walk but now I felt very comfortable.\\r\\n\\nAfter a few minutes I stepped on something sharp and picked my foot up to see if I was bleeding.  Staring at my foot in the moonlight, colorful patterns emerged across my skin and tried to hypnotize me, but I couldn&#x27;t see any injury.  Speaking aloud to myself I said &#x27;My foot, while awesome, is fine.&#x27; and this immediately seemed so funny that I collapsed in laughter.  I laughed at what I&#x27;d said, then laughed at how hard I was laughing.  I began to hyperventilate, and I kept it going intentionally when I realized what I was doing.  I sat there, naked on the asphalt, at 2am, staring up at the full moon breathing as fast and as deep as I could.  My back and chest began to tingle from oxygen deprivation.\\r\\n\\nI calmed down after a while and began to walk again.  Staring up at the sky, I saw what looked like reindeer made of stars flying across the sky above me.  They appeared slow moving, but I knew that was only because they were so far away.  They must be enormous, and moving so fast, I thought.  It was a very ominous, yet majestic sight.\\r\\n\\nAt some point paranoia set in, and I knew I should be getting home.  I couldn&#x27;t remember for sure that I had eaten mushrooms, and wasn&#x27;t convinced at this point that they were physically harmless.  I entertained the thought that I had gone insane or was dying and had to resist the urge to call someone at home to come and get me (I had my cell phone with me).  I felt that I was trapped in my mind, or in a fantasy world and that the only way to get out was either to find someone I knew and have them talk me out of it, or to kill myself.  This latter thought scared the bejesus out of me and I called up my rational mind to talk myself out of it.  It was almost as if I was watching the sober part of my mind try to convince the mushroomed part of my mind that there was no reason to think this way, but felt helpless to provide it with any kind of convincing argument.  I felt real fear that I might be unable to stop myself from committing suicide.  Every time I recognized my surroundings, I forced myself to walk toward home.\\r\\n\\nEven though I had lived on this (perfectly straight) road for over 10 years, I couldn&#x27;t easily identify which direction led home.  My intuitive sense of direction was lost and I had to rely strictly on memory of landmarks to guide me.  Without much memory of the walk back, I found myself in my home, greeted by my dogs, who seemed a little unsure of how to react to me in my state (but that was just my impression).\\r\\n\\nCrawling into bed, I began to calm down and enjoy my state a lot more, although it wasn&#x27;t unequivocally pleasant.  I remember telling my girlfriend that I had almost just killed myself.  After a few panicked questions, I reassured her enough that she went back to sleep.  I started feeling strange delusions.  I began to regard it as true that I was the only real person on Earth and that I was just waking up from a period of dreaming the memories of my life up to that point. I began to regard it as true that I was the only real person on Earth and that I was just waking up from a period of dreaming the memories of my life up to that point.  I felt that I was in an in-between period of remembering my (up until now, real) life and that the things that I had done during that life were the only possible actions; that by doing them, I had defined the set of possibilities for the rest of my eternity.  I lay in bed, remembering my life and waiting for the next phase of existence to begin, feeling relief at a chance to put the worries of this world behind me.  I just lay there, smiling and waiting.\\r\\n\\nIt was during this delusion that I fell asleep.  I woke up feeling embarrassed at the ridiculous things I had said to my girlfriend, making her worry so I wouldn&#x27;t feel so alone.  I felt mentally drained during the day, but fondly remembering the better parts of my trip.  I&#x27;ll definitely eat mushrooms again, but probably not alone, and probably during the day.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Suspecting that each of our paths are meant to illuminate the mysteries of the other, we started a quest  to combine them, searching for a Synergy whose Gnosis would reveal more than available to either path alone.  Brother Logos has followed a medicine path, while I (Brother Ouranoboros) have explored magical techniques and philosophies of western mystery traditions:  We took the first step last Saturday by combining two Initiations into a single experience:  A consecration and first sacrament of a line of Gnostic Bishops with a sacred psilocybin hike up a Holy Mountain...\\r\\n\\nBrother Logos and his initiators treasure a nearby state-park granite mountain -- An ancient bubble of Magma that cooled hundreds of millions of years ago into a massive above-ground loaf of bare rounded granite, 1000 feet high, and 5 miles in circumference.  While the front-side has been carved into a prominent tourist attraction unsuited for psychedelic journeys, there is a hidden route around the back, away from tourists - partially off-limits, and paradoxically preserving some of the best of the park by its undeveloped state and reservation for generators and equipment down at the base.  Exposed tilted plains of granite skirt that base in rising slopes, creating a unique micro-ecology of shallow rain-pools of reflected sky, pale green lichens almost painted on the rock surface like living paisley, and clinging Cacti hugging the rock under direct sun.  Surprisingly soft sponge-like mosses hold water in the shadows of vertical dormant quarry walls.  Dotting the wide expanses, before the rise becomes too vertical, are sparse islands of trees - so plentiful below the mountain -- in shallow pans of root-hoarded dirt.  The hidden path winds and climbs past these few features to rise beyond painted off-limits lines, over or under a raised power conduit that feeds the sky-trams on the other side, to a quiet niche on the bald round mound called the Eagles Nest.  This small scoop of rest into the steep granite overlooks a wide quiet view of forested valley and lake, nestled down below.  \\r\\n\\nFor such a journey, Logos suggested that a psilocybin mushroom tea, with its relatively fast onset (15 minutes) and short duration (about 4 hours), would be an excellent match:  A healthy day hike, to sweat the medicine in the glories of Nature, with no one in normal life even needing to know it was anything but exercise.  This would be a journey away from other people, with enough ardour in climbing and sweating under the direct summer sun and effects of the mushroom tea itself, to facilitate a mirroring of Inner and Outer trips:  A challenging climb up to Eagles Nest beneath the mountaintop, sweating on the medicine trips peak, then slowly sweating out and coming back down in all senses of the word, reintegrating with a baseline reality back down below the painted limit-line to walk away on more familiar terra firma.  \\r\\n\\nIn turn, I (Ouranoboros) suggested a way to frame the experience as a Holy Sacrament by consecrating Logos into a line of wandering, Gnostic Bishops.  The special calling of this tradition is to roam beyond the constraints of visible hierarchy through all apparent differences, transforming the profane into the sacred in the name of Love:  As a newly ordained Bishop, Logos would be empowered by the tradition to elevate ordinary sustenance into the Divine and Healing Body of God as  a Eucharist, whose nourishing absorption would become a means of reunion with the loving heart of the Universe itself...This would of course be performed upon the Mushrooms.      \\r\\n\\nWe set up an altar, bringing together the elements of the consecration ceremony (holy water, oil, incense) and about 10 dried grams of the sacred mushrooms and allied tea ingredients (fresh lemon, ginger root, mint leaves &amp;amp; green tea).  Donning white robes, Ouranoboros performed the traditional ceremony upon Logos, invoking God in all His, and Her, and Its sacred forms and aspects, laying hands on head and anointing power-points (third eye, hands and feet), finally announcing this newest Bishop with a suitable reading from the Gnostic scripture: The Thunder, Perfect Mind (rediscovered as part of the Nag Hammadi find of 1947).  Blessing the mushrooms as the Living Eucharist, Bishop Logos and I thanked the Holy Host for agreeing to connect with us as Living God and Guiding Spirit, speaking aloud our highest intentions for the trip:  Inspiration and Intuition, Adventure and Excitement in a safe and loving way, to descry answers to personal questions in the mirror of Nature, to combine paths of Magic and Psychedelia creatively and positively, and above all, to open us both up to Hidden Powers and Divine Assistance in all manners of need, that might yet be unconscious to ourselves, so that the God of Psilocybin might make us more conscious of, and for, our highest good. \\r\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\nDosage, Timing and Physical Preparation\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\nWe doffed the ceremonial robes and set to work executing the psilocybin tea tek.  Putting 1-2 cups each of purified water on a low heat toward a boil, with an eighth each of the fresh lemon, zest, mint leaves and perhaps a centimeter each of crushed ginger root slices.  The acid in the lemon we believed would speed up the onset, while the other ingredients were added to mitigate stomach upset, as we did not intend to strain the mushroom, aware that this might invite bodily discomfort as an accepted part of the trip.  While the tea basis heated, we each shredded and chopped our pile of mushrooms as finely as possible.  I reserved 4.25 grams, while Logos took the remainder, about 5.5 grams.  When liquid and shrooms were both ready they were combined at the lowest possible simmer, stirred with the tea-bags for ~20 minutes, then decanted with all materia into two travel water bottles with lids.  We then hurried a short drive down the road to the mountain, before the brew might over-cool and lose potency. \\r\\n\\nWe figured onset would take about 15 minutes, and since it was 20 minutes to the park entrance, we quaffed our potions on the road halfway there, 10 minutes into cooling, and 10 minutes from the park entrance.  To my own taste, we had concocted a surprisingly interesting, spicy tea, somewhat like a gingery-minty-lemony mushroom broth we had concocted a surprisingly interesting, spicy tea, somewhat like a gingery-minty-lemony mushroom broth!  Having this surprising omen, I thought to myself this boded well (totally right!) and that there would be no discomfort (totally wrong!).  Nature too had granted us excellent weather with a welcome cold-front, driving the temperature down from previous low 100s to low 80s F. I knew I, for one, would be grateful for whatever reprieve from the direct heat we might receive upon the bare rock.  Thinking ahead, we had both brought wide-brimmed hats, sunscreen, a lot of bottled water and a large electrolyte rich drink (coconut-water) in case we should purge, and other than water, we had both fasted.  We were prepared, if our packs were a bit heavy with it all!\\r\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\nThe Journey &amp;amp; The Experience \\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\nWe felt excited at the park entrance, feeling a rush of blood in the fingertips and lips and traces of visual distortion coming on as threshold indicators that we were soon to be immersed in a powerful encounter with the Sacred.  After driving around to park in an out of the way location, we began the hike.  I felt a touch drunk as we entered a wooded area and crossed over the train tracks that wrap around the base of the mountain, and which provide tourists a wild-west shoot-out show.  Within a very brief time we entered the hidden pathway up the back-side to our intended destination.\\r\\n\\n            ~~~~~Welcome Back, Old Friend!~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\nPerhaps 2 minutes after crossing the tracks, and coming out onto what seemed a vast plain of sloping granite, I realized my body was VERY HEAVY and that I was equally HOT under the direct glare of the Sun, with my heavy pack full of waters, and hat (usually quite light-weight) heating up my flushed head.  I had already opened one of my waters and was grateful no one was around, as I could tell I was having trouble moving ahead.  I fought a wave of nausea that dragged behind it an engulfing first wave of powerful alterations on every level -- Bodily sensations, awareness of surroundings changing, inner thoughts, beliefs &amp;amp; memories all widening scope and re-combining.  As for bodily sensation, my stomach felt overflowing with bubbly gas foam, and I could taste too much ginger that I had added to the Tea (ironically, to fight nausea).  I was quietly afraid that I might puke right off and collapse in a heat stroke if I didnt sit down (and there was no place to sit), and that I was dangerously old and out of shape to climb a mountain while trespassing on unauthorized drugs --  WHAT HAD I DONE!?\\r\\n\\nMy talkative friend Logos, weaving a bit on the slope as he struck a line tangential to the mountain ascent, later indicated he was feeling the same nausea and doubts, although he is not yet 30, in good hiking shape and familiar with the medicine.  Apropos to both our minds, he declared aloud forcefully as if announcing to the Universe and not just myself, that Terrence McKenna once said No matter how many times I trip, when I experience that first powerful wave overwhelm me, I always say to myself uh-oh, WHAT HAVE I DONE!? and this is when I (speaking, I think now, as Logos) tell myself over and over Welcome back Old Friend!  Welcome Back!\\r\\n\\nI took strength in this, and knew Logos was Quite Right -- I knew as well, that the tissue of normal life had ripped  away:  We now walked a landscape of Sacred &amp;amp; Eternal Time Trip Time, the strange truehome which had patiently awaited our re-arrival. It and We were well-known to each other, never been truly separated -- the illusion of normal life and its succession of seemingly disconnected moments.  All Trips, All Magicks came from and returned to this One Moment under the surface where every terrifying and supremely defining thing had ever really happened .  I knew I needed to not give in to sickness in this moment, by immediately accepting  this Moment to not be sick.  Contained also in that phrase Welcome Back Old Friend! was the fact that I had always known Logos as my brother for far longer than normal life would indicate, that he was as much the Old Friend that I intuitively recognized as Magick and Trip Time and the experience itself;  He and I and we even represented in that Moment many absent others who had all been, and forever would and will be, in this same connected-forgotten reality beneath the tissue of normal life.  And that this Moment of Reality had now suddenly risen up to say hello as a bit of nausea-stomach-foam, yet wise to the fact that this was just the leading edge of a much deeper wave that had already swept us away.  It was time to let go, and ride that wave.    \\r\\n\\nWe teetered along the tilted plain on an oblique path to the upward slope, traveling a few hundred meters, when I suddenly remembered to put on my sunscreen for protection.  I asked Logos if he could extract it from my backpack, but he could not figure out which of the many pockets it was tucked into.  I took off the pack, felt so instantly RELIEVED of its water weight for a moment, took off my hat and fanned myself, felt stronger, fished out the SPF-50 lotion and -- Wait, how had it already spilled on the ground, had I opened it already!?  Never mind -- somehow that focused me to practicalities, and I slathered my arms, face, neck, stowed the sunblock, and put my pack and hat back on, feeling stronger for being practical and prepared.  Logos pointed out an Oasis of shade just ahead, which we would reach by continuing to skirt the mountain for a while, and I was glad to discover the oasis was a part of the planned path forward to the Top.\\r\\n\\n    ~~~~~~~~Here is Where I Hear the Echoes of a Future Silence~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\nThe oasis was quite pleasant, and in due time absorbed the initial load of fear with its hidden offerings of beauty!  Surrounded by a half dozen small trees and a 6 foot vertical wall where a quarry cut out blocks of granite a century ago, it was flat, and now sheltered a shallow reflecting pool of water, edged by a 4 inch thick spongy carpet of cool moss which oozed water at the touch.  Delightful!  It felt like I was ticking the whole mountain.  I let Logos talk as I slowly mastered my sense of Nausea, drank water and peed:  I knew I would not puke.  Last time we were here, we rolled upon these grasses! said Logos, remembering past trips here with his psychedelic family.  Seeing the mosses absorb and release their water, I felt I had kicked-started a successful sweat cycle and would not overheat.  While I still felt some manageable discomfort in my body, I felt this as the Spirit of the Mushrooms at work strengthening my body to become much healthier in the long run.  As we gathered our strength for the present climb,  I declared aloud Here is Where I Hear the Echoes of a Future Silence.  I did not know exactly what I meant, or if indeed I meant it or if the Mushroom had spoken it, but just that I must say it, and was certain it would become revealed to me at a later time.  I thank the Spirit of the Mushrooms for making me Stronger! I declared as I put on my pack, and it was so.  I was excited again.  Logos spoke We can climb whenever you are ready.  I saw the imposing rise of 1000 feet rising up like a wall in the background, and replied,  The Spirit of the Mushrooms is moving through us up the Mountain!  I think it will draw us upward.  Where is the Eagles Nest?  Logos pointed a little over half-way up, It is there above that island of trees.  Oh, that is not so far!  I replied, and we set out again under the direct sun, stepping now directly upward against the slope.  \\r\\n\\nI heard thunderous slow cracking noises as shards were kicked or set free.  There were many such shards, and it occured to me they were all in motion down the mountain, just too slowly to see outside of mountain time.  In many places the ramping slope had been broken by erosion and by cleavage into occasional steps to hop and climb, and I could see exactly how the mountain was melting in its own time frame, and the rivers of its downward flow were as easy to see, as the breathing iridescent island of trees above.  We walked upward against that same flowing river of gravity.   \\r\\n\\n~~~~~&quot;Weve been in Mexico for some time now.&quot;  Finding the seat of Power. ~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\nI felt no compunction to try and push myself up the mountain as I might do in a normal hike for exercise, but took whatever size steps and side-movements seemed right at that exact moment.  Nausea no longer threatened to overwhelm, but still acted as a natural governor on any attempts to over-exert -- This was to be a trip of attention, the sweating and effort was to be a side-effect more than a feature.  Because of the Medicine and the Sun, sweat poured out of my body nevertheless, and gathered on the tips of my upright arm hairs -- A cool breeze rewarded our approach and we reveled in it. \\r\\n\\n It did not take long to reach the Island of trees about half-way up the Mountain. We rested while standing, drinking water, peeing again.  Off to the  left of the trees was the power conduit, running up to the top to to supply the sky-tram for the tourists going up and down the other side.  It was sheathed in a metal pipe, raised above the surface on 4 foot A-frames that were bolted to the granite slope.  I expected the metal to be burning hot, but in the tree shaded area where we would cross, it was comfortable to the touch.   While it was obviously not intended to be crawled over or under, it was possible to do so:  Following Logos lead, I climbed over, taking care to distinguish the stable from the unstable parts of the assemblage.  \\r\\n\\nSuddenly we could hear faint echoes of a loud P.A. system, wafting up the mountain from below.  It was dialogue, layered above that iconic Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western gunslinger sound-track theme, which plays whenever Clint Eastwood shoots somebody in A Fistful of Dollars.  I knew full well in my mind that this was coming from the staged train robbery for the tourists below, but echoing faintly across the distance, it sounded to me as if all the words were in Spanish!  Logos agreed, and I replied Oh yes, weve been in Mexico for some time now.  Logos burst out laughing, and I spotted the perfect rock, level and well sized, for sitting on.  I needed to sit down, and so I did.  I suddenly saw well across the valley below with perfect clarity two tiny deer coming out from the forest and looking up at us, responding to my mental commands to come out and show themselves.  I explained to Logos Look!  We are Naguals!  Logos did not know what I meant, having no familiarity with Carlos Castaneda and his encounters with the Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan Matus (which surprised me). I explained a little bit about Don Juan and his Apprentice -- and my feeling that in this eternal Moment, where all paths and times and experiences converge, that part of us which were Gnostic Bishops were also elsewhere as Sorcerers in Mexico, a kind of magical linkage that defied traditional categorizations of separateness.  We decided we would explore leveraging that connection to see what power or wisdom it might reveal.  \\r\\n\\nI suddenly realized that I had found the true Sitio of this place for me, the Seat of Power, like Don Juans first strange lesson to Castaneda, the importance to the Sorcerer of finding that Sitio and not confusing it for some other.  I knew then (but kept it to myself) that the Seat of Power in this place would not be for me the Eagles Nest.  I explained that here in this situation, seated in this overlook, the last of the Nausea was being transformed from sickness to Power inside my belly.  \\r\\n\\nWe decided to push on to the Eagles Nest to finish the ascent, the goal very close by, just about 100 meters more up a final steep slope, one that required walking slowly at angles not to slip, leaning in to the slope, and gripping down through the soles of the feet like mountain goats.  There was a great deal of long-faded graffiti from visitors past on the final approach, but the one that stood out was an old faded Cross and Christian fish, with an unreadable scripture reference, reminding us of the Gnostic Eucharist at work to embrace a Truth beyond the limits of all seemingly separate traditions or creeds -- and which to me had just revealed a kind of Univeralism in the form of parallel magical lives across time and space.  Praise Jesus in the Mushroom for the Sorceries of Mexico upon our hidden mountain!\\r\\n\\nAt last we reached the Eagles Nest, a gentle divet of erosion scooped like a 10 foot niche from the rounded mountain side, with a flat base, easy to stand upon and room for two or more to rest, relax, and take in the view.  Logos invited me to sit, but I did not feel as if I should, feeling it would be difficult for me to get back up again from the bare rock floor (I am too heavy).  I enjoyed the last vestiges of trails in my vision, but more interestingly, the fact that I could see better without glasses than with them.  At this point the stopped train somewhere below sounded its horn very loudly as it began to move, to a great cheering of the tourists, and Logos discoursed on the pomp of Man and his need to announce his presence to the Universe.  I felt comfortable with them below, and understood their need for an existential shout or two as part of the pattern that rules below -- We however, were not there and were safely higher.  I did not wish or feel that it was time for the trip to end, but felt that we would do better to return to the Sitio.  When Logos agreed, we returned.\\r\\n\\nThere at the Sitio -- and again thereafter as we slowly, slowly descended and lingered on the way down, enjoying the easy come-down, making tupas of standing stones in breezes and welcome showers of rain, we spoke of many, many things too numerous and personal to share, all leading back to our present identities and reality.  We spoke of the different lives we had lead even within this one and how they brought us to this Moment, of present challenges and personal predicaments, and we did not forget to perform the divination (by clouds, which responded rather robustly) that we had asked for at the outset.\\r\\n\\nSo much more could be (and was) said, but in the end, those things shall be recalled from secrecy to mind by us, when we read this testament, and we end this record here with the thankful affirmation to the Universe that it was a successful Synergy of Magical and Medicine paths for us, the first rather than the last.  We re-integrated with normal life below the painted off-limits lines a little wiser, a little more focused on next steps and refreshed, and leave this testimony here for future discovery and reflection.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nA normal weekend, other than the rare and sudden call from a friend who could obtain those mushrooms I was always looking for. I let most of my friends have first dibs on the stuff and then I just kept what was left over. My friends had described heavy trips off of very small doses of this certain strain. Most of the friends taking doses of around 2 grams or less.\\r\\n\\nIt was a normal monday night, bowling league night for my place of work, a few coworkers and a manager making up the remainder of the team. I sit at home after taking a shower and getting ready for the night at hand. The remainder of the mushrooms were sitting on my desk and I had intended on taking some for the night of bowling. I knew I had about 7.5 grams left and I didn&#x27;t want to really have to deal with having them in my possession any longer than I already had. I save a gram and a half for one of my team members and pour the remaining 6 grams onto my desk and prepare to consume. I start to eat them, downing them with a handy soda. Typical mushroom taste and stomach feeling. And then it is time to leave. **Disclaimer: Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of any mind altering substance is extremely dangerous and is probably not a good idea (of course it took this experience to realize the severity of that claim)**\\r\\n\\n[Erowid Note: \\nDriving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don&#x27;t do it!] \\n\\nI take off down the highway for my about 20-30 minute trip to the bowling alley. When I get closer to the alley I notice and extreme increase in the amount of lights that are usually around that area of town. I&#x27;m driving and thinking that I feel really good, but there is a slow realization that this is just the beginning of something huge.\\r\\n\\nI arrive at the bowling alley, still climbing, but rapidly. I go into the bowling alley, and there are visuals abound, morphing of designs and colors, and they are the most intense visuals I have ever seen (so far at least). I find my teammates and tell the non-manager ones what I have consumed just to keep them in the know.\\r\\n\\nAt this point I had gone to get a large lemonade and had settled down in a good seat. We luckily had to bowl against a ghost team, which would likely lessen the possible problems that my state of mind might cause. I start to become overwhelmed with anxiety. I have always had the anxiety before the peak of mushroom trips, but this time it was more intense and was actually frightening me at one point. I was convinced that I couldn&#x27;t handle being in a public place and I kept telling my teammates that I was going to go home, which would have actually been the worst idea. \\r\\n\\nAt this point I am experiencing ever increasing visuals (like seeing myself drinking out of a pool of lemonade whenever I took a drink from my beverage), and feel that I am on the verge of a panic attack. I&#x27;m slowly realizing that there is nothing I can do to stop what is coming, and I finally give up my mental fight of control.\\r\\n\\nThis is the gateway into my real trip, my peak where all of this has been leading up to. I would say there was about 2 hours in between me eating the mushrooms initially and the peak. My mind loses its attachment from reality and I am plunged into a very intense, long, and spiritual journey. The way I rationalize my mental state is the following:\\r\\n\\nIf you think of your mind in two parts, the part that controls yourself in the real world, and your unconscious. I believe that I, the normal controller of my physical body was plunged into the world of my unconscious and the physical body was controlled by the unconscious and was able to function in a minimal fashion. Later talks with my bowling team mates said I bowled normally, but didn&#x27;t talk to any of them expect for random illegible comments throughout the night.\\r\\n\\nAnyways, the visuals were intense yet intermittent. I would be bowling a frame, and I would see a few different things. First I would see other people bowling, but at the end of their approach they would go into slow motion and everyone would slowly turn their heads and stare very deeply into my eyes. Other times I would be bowling a frame, and I would see nobody in the bowling alley, keep in mind that this was a pretty busy night for the bowling alley, with the league and monday night football going on. And my mind would go through these visuals multiple times throughout the whole night of bowling.\\r\\n\\nAs for what I was going through mentally. I began thinking of the universe, and I slowly started breaking down layers and layers of actual existence until I got to the lowest form of life, atoms. I went through every chemistry and physics class I had ever taken in around thirty minutes. And after thinking of all the molecular science, I went on and convinced myself, that the world we live in, the existence that I had survived in for so many years, wasn&#x27;t real. This was a hard thing to come to terms with for me, it was a very profound thought, and such a shock to my system. Existence was nonexistence. At this point I had probably been peaking for around 2 hours, 2 hours of no control over my own reality.\\r\\n\\nAnd bowling was over, we bowled three games and I averaged about a 150 for the night which was actually pretty normal for me at that time. I think the shock of knowing I had to leave kind of kicked me out of my mental trip. I continued to have strong visual hallucinations but I had regained control of my body in the physical realm. \\r\\n\\nMe and one of my team members decide to go to a local mexican restaurant to get some post bowling munchies. I get there and decide to order the 15 dollar order of nachos that is made for like four people, when there is only me and one friend. We get the nachos and about 3 chips in I lose interest and want to go home. Holding interest in food when I have been on mushrooms has always been a hard task for me. Other motivating factors were the heavy visuals that I was still having, seeing many other people in the restaurant with deformed faces. \\r\\n\\nI get home and continue to body trip for a few hours before falling asleep, waking up in the morning, the world is fresh and everything feels brand new.\\r\\n\\nLet me just say that this one experience, was life changing and changed the way I thought about everything from that day forth. For the people who want to know about religious and spiritual experiences, this is one of my first, and after the initial anxiety it was very very intense and good. I believe my state of mind at the beginning of the night was one of the deciding factors on the possibility of a bad trip. It was a good day and I was in positive spirits before taking the mushrooms. And if I had not been in a good mood, this could have been a very disastrous experience for my mind to go through.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] \\n\\nBackground:\\r\\n\\nSince September of my senior year in high school, I have been experimenting with drugs both in hopes of gaining insight into my problems, interest and self-medication. It has been roughly two years since then and my list of drug exploits includes weed, shrooms, LSD, MDMA in rock form and in cut rolls, 2c-e, 25-I nbome, cocaine, a few pills (which I try to stay away from), alcohol, and a few other unimportant things not worth mentioning. Out of everything, I prefer psychedelics.\\r\\n\\nSet and Setting:\\r\\n\\nI had tripped shrooms on a number of occasions, somewhere around twenty times I believe, but had never gone any higher than 1/8. Psychedelics have always teased me in one way or another; I always feel as though Im on the edge of having a genuine psychedelic experience that is utterly life-changing and lives up to what people like Timothy Leary would describe it as, but instead only gain interesting perspective and insight. Not that that is a bad thing, but I always strive for more. So you can imagine my delight when I heard that my friend was bringing some shrooms into town (a nice surprise considering this town never gets good drugs). I had money, and decided that despite how intense it was bound to be (I personally think that shrooms are more intense than LSD), I was going to eat a whole 7 grams. We planned to leave the house we stayed in and go to a trail near campus to experience the trip in nature. My opinion is that if the earth is kind enough to give us a fruit as important as psychedelic mushrooms, we should honor it by experiencing the spirit of the earth while we trip. \\r\\n\\nThe Trip:\\r\\n\\nI bought the quarter and had somewhat low hopes for the shrooms. They didnt look very well grown compared to all the other good shrooms Ive eaten (Ive tripped on shrooms 20 something times, at least enough to consider myself well versed at the time). I later realized that the shrooms, which were black, were black because of how much bluing they had. \\r\\n\\n8:00 pm  I eat and eighth of shrooms, not expecting to feel anything for at least an hour like normal, given my somewhat high tolerance. Even good shrooms usually take a while to hit me noticeably.\\r\\n\\n8:30  I feel them, quite noticeably in fact. I cram around two more grams into my mouth. \\r\\n\\n8:45  Good God am I high. No visual distortions have occurred but I fee unutterably strange. My friends and I (one of whom has never eaten shrooms before and just ate an eighth) decide to head to the woods. \\r\\n\\n9:15  Weve hiked a good way up the trail so I decide to light up a joint. Shortly thereafter the roof of trees over our heads begins gyrating into an incredibly beautiful web of starry swirls and kaleidoscopic webbing. My friends, who have eaten less than I have, see the same thing, especially my crazily giggly friend who had never tripped before. I can tell these shrooms are very high quality. They were very smooth and had cleaner visuals than any shrooms I had eaten before.\\r\\n\\n9:30  My best friend, who was chilling at the house, calls me, furious, while Im in the woods and hits me with a load of complete BS about how even though I had bought him an eighth of shrooms the week earlier, I had told him I didnt need the money back (he was mistaken, I am poor) and that I wasnt a real friend and that I had blindsided him by leaving him out of this nights trip. Needless to say, these negative emotions began to make me feel incredibly uneasy, and I was bombarded with intense emotions. He tells me the money he just paid me back with is his, and hes incredibly pissed that he has to leave the house to come get it from me so he can have fun too. I reluctantly decide to cave and give him the money, not wanting the bad vibes to ruin what I had planned on being the most spiritual night of my somewhat hard at that point life. \\r\\n\\n9:40  We meet on the trail. He apologizes, I accept though I know hes just happy to have gotten his way. Its unimportant, I just dont want negative energy surrounding me.\\r\\n\\n9:50  I walk up the trail to find my friends but find myself alone as one of them has left the woods and the other has only journeyed deeper to find himself. At this point I am somewhat nervous. I have never eaten this many shrooms, and still upset from what just happened, and the trip is really starting to kick in. plus, Im alone in the woods and its dark. The stars begin warping and the moon is changing colors rapidly, and all around me the earth is breathing as if to tell me it is just as much a living soul as I. The negative energy starts to effect the visuals, and a tree about 200 feet up the path starts rolling towards me with furious speed. Never had visuals like that before. I decide to walk back to the house and join a friend who is tripping there alone. He also hasnt eaten shrooms before.\\r\\n\\n10:20  I make it to the house and remember that I have more shrooms and I joint that is a foot and a half long that I rolled before the trip. Life is good, Im forgetting the negative vibes. I sit to smoke the joint with my friend, whose face is blinking in every color imaginable. In the yard behind the back porch, the plants have turned into chainsaws that are bright green with intensely red blades, and are whipping back and forth. Runic symbols in what I took to be a language humans arent meant to understand sprout from everything, rends in the fabric of life itself appear and sprout kaleidoscopic patterns of stunning intricacy. Holy shit, these are good shrooms. I am having the deepest conversation I have ever had with a person Ive never met. I eat the rest of the shrooms.\\r\\n\\n10:30  The shrooms are just too intense for me. I cant even see anymore, my breathing is heavy and I am incredibly nauseous. I start to think I am going to die, so I have my friend (whose words I cannot understand or even hear) guide me to the room. I am scared but come to the realization after exploring the most intricate visuals I have ever seen (the open eye and closed eye are no different at this point) that I am in unique state that many people arent lucky enough to experience. My concept of myself disappears entirely, it is the oddest feeling. I am literally just space and time. Whats odder, even though I feel as though the universe and I are one, I enter a realm that I am not part of. The patterns are forming doorways that lead to different realms. I walk down a spiral staircase in my mind that leads to what I can only describe as Hell, and immediately leave. I interpret this as rejection of all the negative energy I have felt for the past three years. I emerge from Hell to walk into a land my friend would later describe as Valhalla. I am in the sky, walking on the air. I get the distinct impression that the gods have allowed me to come to this place, and am immensely thankful. Forests of incredible detail that look like something out of the movie Avatar sprout around my feet with every footstep. And then I come to a giant golden wall, curved inward to a single point in the center. Eyes sprout out of it. They are powerful, they can see right through me. They show me visions of the future, fill me with emotions, and communicate all sorts of things about me that gave me a whole new understanding of myself. It was unpleasant, but I was grateful. I am confronted by a large wall of intense energy, and through it I see the silhouette of what I interpret to be an elder in this godly kingdom. He begins to shout, and runes of the godly language sprout from everything around me. Six other elders join him, and they all begin to shout. When their shouts come together, they form a collective voice that speaks in a language that I have no idea how I understand, and it fills me with peace and shows me what I will do with my future. \\r\\n\\n12:00 am  I can see now, but the visuals are still insane. I am astounded by what I just experienced, and am filled with a huge amount of energy for some reason. I feel like a wolf, a master of my own being. I laugh and entertain myself reciting trippy poetry off the top of my head. My friends return from the woods. I can hardly talk coherently unless its something outlandish and trippy. The walls of the house appear to be coated in red, sweaty skin. I am still surprised by how powerful these shrooms were. The rest of the night is occupied with a seven foot bong and lying in bed unable to sleep.\\r\\n\\nIn Retrospect:\\r\\n\\nThis was the most profound experience of my life. This amount of quality shrooms is not for everyone but suffice it to say if you decide to eat this amount it will most likely be a textbook psychedelic experiencecreativity is booming, complete destruction of the ego, utterly life-changing. I am different than when I started, but I feel spiritually reborn.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

I&#x27;m not new to this experience, and yet this one is unique enough to feel new. This is still hard to type. For some reason its hard to communicate, even through writing. \\r\\n\\nI ate about 7.5 grams of what this dude called Treasure Cove shrooms (lmao) and smoked about a gram of weed during the experience. I tripped with a good friend of mine. So we got into his apartment and shut the door behind us (didnt want his roommates to know about this) and got the shrooms out. We ate them around 9 PM (me slower than him, ha) and then I rolled up a blunt and we walked outside. I smoked and we talked as our surroundings started to flicker with unnatural movement. We went back inside and sat down and watched JonTron and I started to laugh uncontrollably. I had this feeling that I had multiple faces on my head, all with different expressions like mad laughter in one, and anger in another. My friend walked off and then I was alone. \\r\\n\\nThe walls were turning really yellow and had beautiful geometric patterns on them. I was focused on this when I heard a voice. It sounded like my own but much deeper, and negative. It was threatening to make this trip into a bad one. It threatened to take away my sanity. It threatened to expose my secrets and take away any control I had over my mind. It was really freaking me out. I closed my eyes and I saw a new world with my eyes shut. Mostly white landscape, like if grass grew white instead of green. I saw a figure and tensed up. This voice was personified just as a shadow that morphed around into humanoid shapes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I was back on Earth in the room that was previously morphing around and my friend was sitting there with me. I didnt have a problem with this voice again. \\r\\n\\nIt was getting hard to concentrate on the videos.  We started to watch some Durhamrockerz Youtube Poop (perfect for tripping for some reason",
       ") and I started to roll another blunt. I realized that I gave the lighter I borrowed earlier from his roommates back to them. They were kinda mad (I think?) about us not sharing shroom, so I didnt wanna go ask for a light. We decided to walk to the gas station. We were still coming up but the world around me was morphing and I couldnt stop laughing as we walked up the road. He started talking about some emotional things with me (I recently had a death in my life thats changed a lot of shit) and it kinda made me feel overwhelmed. I felt like Id lose my mind if I thought about the bad parts of life too hard. I started to stumble around a little bit but I didnt tell him about it so I could just make the feeling go away. I didnt want to feel too overwhelmed again. I dropped the weed on the grass and we decided wed go back for it on the way back from the gas station, so we didnt look like we dropped drugs on the ground and were looking for them. We made our descent down this grassy hill and onto the manmade cement weird structure that was the gas station, with all its buzzing. Oh lawd, here we go I said. \\r\\n\\nWe went inside and went straight to the back for a Coke Zero. We got in line and it was kinda busy in there, so we were smacked in between this Hispanic family in front of us and an entire line of people behind us. I had to be cool. I had to keep calm, no crazy laughter or faces. Oh my god the kid in front of me has most of his head shaved except for the back??? How am I not supposed to laugh at that? I start cracking a grin but its crooked because Im trying to hide my delight at what the Universe has just shown me. They FINALLY leave and I laugh a little more before hiding it again and putting my coke on the counter. Get that lighter,  I muttered as I pointed at the Bic lighters. I make eye contact with the lady behind the counter, doing her 3rd shift shit. Shes miserable and pissy. Im trying not to be too obvious but she knows. I shoot the shit with her, barely. I dont even know if all the words got out. Shes like have a good night YEP I replied as I grabbed my shit from her and walked off. Got out of that store and exploded with nervous laughter that cascaded into normal cackling. We reflected on the haircut and the entire experience with various Did you see that??? chirps and ran back up the hill and found the weed.\\r\\n\\nWe went back inside so I could finish rolling it, and it was incredibly hard this time around to roll it. It was all loosely packed, but still good. We went in the backyard next to this air conditioning unit and I started smoking. The weed was a little weird to hit because I rolled it all shitty, so I got determined and fixed it. Finally, got my smokeable blunt. The air conditioning unit kicked on as I lit the weed. I hit it and it didnt even feel like smoking. It didnt bother my lungs at all and I took these huge hits and smoked it really fast. My friend and I were peaking on our trip and the visuals were fantastic. Fractals and patterns spiraling out and turning my reality into a rainbow crystal, jagged wonderland. The trees were frigid and glass looking, their patterns repeating forever. The stars were zooming around. There was heat lighting out (wasnt just imagining that either) but somehow the stars were still out. Made for a really bizarre habitat I decided to visit that night. So my friend and I get to talking about weird shit, and I get really emotionally invested in some theory about how our money has always been based on gold and its because aliens ingested it for immortality. He was like well what about money that isnt based on gold? and I thought for a moment. I didnt really have an answer for that, except that maybe we were evolving. I couldnt shake this weird, rapidly growing feeling of an epiphany coming on. I thought Why did I cling so hard to that idea when all I can really prove is that I know nothing at all? I knew nothing, I was a speck of dirt. A tiny grain of sand on some cosmic beach, beyond time. If I knew nothing, then I am nothing. If &#x27;I think, therefore I am&#x27; were true at all, then I was toast. I might as well not exist. The space around me started to spin, like a dizzy spell of vertigo but in another language, so to speak. This epiphany was too much. Things were about to get really insane.\\r\\n\\nMy visuals got wild, spiraling from all kinds of directions and looking jagged and sharp, but in colors so vivid they were almost new to my eyes. The fractals began to pulse along with some weird beating sensation inside of me and I noticed this strange, white light opening up from the sky behind my head. I saw it first in my peripheral vision and then it stayed as I questioned Does my friend see this too? I tried to ask him if he saw that weird light but its like I forgot how to communicate. I forgot spoken language and I couldnt convey body language either. I was still overwhelmed by the nothingness I felt from not-knowing and the white light grew brighter, and brighter, and then it filled my entire field of vision. My friend was speaking to me but his voice slowly faded out and was replaced with this loud roaring, like some kind of engine. I started to scream, but I couldnt scream with my mouth, only my thoughts. I felt little moans and murmurs come out of my mouth instead. The white light was blinding and I could see no more as something held me down. I could not get back up. It felt like if someone were to take a car tire to the back of your head and rev the engine, but the wheel was made of plasmatic white light. Then it also felt like someone or something was cleaning my brain but scrubbing too hard. Instead of the feeling of &#x27;I&#x27;m not supposed to be here&#x27;, I felt at home. This felt natural, as if some force or being was cleaning out my soul and saying &#x27;Tsk, Tsk, look at the mess of a being you are&#x27;. It made me think of when a child wrecks their house and a parent tends to the mess, annoyed but still expressing unconditional love for their child by cleaning up after it. \\r\\n\\nI&#x27;m not sure what that force or being would be, but I could sense something there. It could&#x27;ve been some instinctual feeling, some &#x27;one with the universe&#x27; thing. I felt totally merged with the flow of not just my home world, but planes I have walked. I was just another jagged turn in a fractal pattern, another crest in an endless wave. Another wellspring of thoughts, of consciousness contemplating itself. A face that blends with an infinite amount of other faces to make up the whole oneness of whatever we are, whatever the Universe is, whatever consciousness is. Nothing else mattered.\\r\\n\\nI&#x27;m dying! I cant get up and theres this roaring I hear that I cant explain! This is truly the end! I thought of how fun my life had been and I was so thankful. I had so much fun! The good definitely outweighed the bad! I know Ill try harder in the next life! and I accepted dying. Goodbye beautiful world, I thought. I braced myself but nothing, just more white light. Then, Planet Earth slowly fizzled back into my sight, as the trees in the backyard manifested themselves again. More and more of my vision came back and I realized I was holding onto the grass and dirt of the Earth beneath me. The roaring was still there and I processed more of my surroundings for what felt like forever and then the roaring stopped so suddenly, it was almost like somebody popped the bubble of whatever weird dimension I got stuck in. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. He was like Are you okay? What happened? over and over but I couldnt speak. I couldnt speak about this for a day or so in completion. I got parts out but communication really failed me, especially at first. I dont remember saying anything except Im coming back, Im coming back as my soul came back into my body and learned to speak again (or thats what it felt like",
       ") and I took a while to process everything. I looked down and saw my hands and the jeans on my legs and the rest of my body. Im a girl. I have a name",
       "yeah",
       "things came back slowly. I knew this guy next to me but it was hard to figure out exactly who he was. I couldnt remember much, I had to recollect the people I love. It wasnt too hard but it was eerie that it took any effort at all. At least I was already with someone I was extremely comfortable with. \\r\\n\\nI slowly came back and started speaking to my friend and one of the first things I remember was turning around and being like THAT! THAT RIGHT THERE! because I figured out what that roaring was. The air conditioning unit noise had been turned into some kind of cosmic mechanical roar that locked me in place in that other dimension (the white light) by its sound alone. I remember talking more but I dont remember what about. I think he was trying to get me to stay calm and explain what happened, but it was near impossible. We sat and talked for a while (still cant remember about what) and then we went inside. I was still tripping pretty hard. We started watching Malcolm in the Middle and I was in a nice place. I kept giggling at the dumbest shit. I still couldnt explain what had just happened. I was still trying to process it, but got distracted easily by shit. I had the attention span of a baby. I remember looking at the clock and it was about 2 AM. We talked into the night about various things. I had an amazing experience with him, I was so happy to get to do this. I felt so peaceful with my old friend, just chatting like we used to. Hes always been important to me but I never realized how much until this trip. \\r\\n\\nWe finished Malcolm In the Middle (it was the episode where the family goes out to dinner with Stevies family, lmao! Perfect episode!) and we started to feel the mushrooms leave us. It became easier for me to talk and remember more of what happened, but at this point it was getting late. We were yawning and we crawled into bed and went to sleep after some chatter. I slept for about 6 hours and went to work the next day after eating some lunch with my friend and dicking around at a couple of stores. Work was interesting (I work at an organic grocery store) and I felt spaced out but whole. I felt at peace for the first time in a long time. My normal social anxiety had vanished for the day at least. No HPPD or anything, and the shrooms had a very clean high similar to 1P-LSD, but shorter and with much crazier visuals. \\r\\n\\nWas an overall incredible and pleasant experience.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

Im very careful about who I choose to shroom with because I dont think everyone is cut out to take them.  From personal experience Ive grasped that it is extremely mentally based, if a person seems too nervous, too wound up, scared or mentally not completely stable, I wont even think about shrooming with them.  Positive vibes throughout a trip are very important so we have to go into together and comfortable with each other.  Addie is a very chill girl so I knew it wouldnt be a problem.\\r\\n\\nPreparations:\\r\\n\\nIve shroomed about 8+ times now (shes tripped around 6+) and I like to be extremely prepared before I decide to cross onto the other side because once I cross over there is no turning back, and distraction from a task becomes increasingly more plausible.  \\r\\n\\nIn preparation for the trip we both decided to pack an adventure backpack.  Wed each just fill it with engaging things that we thought would be fun while tripping.  Im an art major, and shes very into art so both our backpacks were packed full of art making supplies.  In my backpack, I packed a camera, my sketchbook, art books full of pictures, candles, a bouncy ball, a blanket, and (of course) my ipod.\\r\\n\\nHer backpack contained more colored pencils, glitter, glue (and other various art making supplies) her laptop, speakers, 8 diet cokes, gummy bears and gum.  \\r\\n\\nWe knew that as soon as we actually started the trip, we may never use any of these things, but as long as I FEEL prepared, I dont go into tripping with any negative mindset of forgetting anything, or missing something.  Also, the backpack helps keep everything together so you dont end up loosing things while tripping.\\r\\n\\nT:: (1:40pm) This is the only time Ill give exact time because a promise of our trip was to avoid a clock until we were done, since all perception of time is usually lost. We decided to go to campus.  We have a very beautiful and old campus, with tons of foliage.  Its winter break so its empty on campus, and weve both tripped there before, and each time its a different, amazing experience.  \\r\\n\\nWe arrive at our first camp site as we referred to it  It was in a grassy area near a wall covered in ivy, we were under big trees that were  completely BRIGHT yellow, red and green in color (probably more so because of the shrooms) and it was about 70 out, with a slight wind.   It was an especially beautiful spot because every so often the wind would gust and it would literally rain and array of yellow, red and green leaves.  We laid out the blanket to sit down and begin our trip. \\r\\n\\nBy this time we were already starting to feel the effects.  We had the body high on the walk over, and as Addie described it, she could feel them [the hallucinations] creeping in as we sat down at our site.  We got out the computer and speakers and began to listen to the soundtrack of the trip which was the Across the Universe soundtrack.  \\r\\n\\nAcross the Universe soundtrack was always music Ive wanted to listen to while tripping, and hadnt yet, she agreed.  Music is very important on a trip because its unavoidable, whenever I am hearing music, my mood changes accordingly.  This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation. This soundtrack was especially good because it has songs with different moods, and deeper and partially drug induced meanings, which while on drugs, inspires lots of deep contemplation. \\n\\nWe then began to create art, and we would feed off each others creations, and add.  We found leaves and glued them into our sketchbooks and drew from their random coloration as flowing inspiration.  The best thing about drawing and coloring while tripping is that you dont have to think about, every movement makes sense and comes natural, and you like it, you dont second guess your drawing, and you appreciate your creations more.  \\r\\n\\n Addie drew a comic book character.  I told her I could just SEE, and just knew he needed glitter.  We named him Senior Fancy, and his job was to spread glitter to the world, making it a better place.  Throughout our trip wed reference him and add to the story.  We added Bueno Bums as his accomplices to his glitter spreading ways.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about an assortment of deep and insightful things.  I can always tell a shroom conversation from a normal one because insightful things on shrooms are always things I never would talk about normally, although they make sense, they just dont come to mind sober.   This is one of the amazing things about shrooms, because when I sober up later, theyre still amazing ideas that I get to take with me from the trip.   \\r\\n\\nWe talked about all the people in the world, and how so many of them live their life each day separately, and well never know or meet most of them.  Yet they keep living in their own world.  And we were sad that we cant just go up and talk to anyone.  And we were sad because so many people seemed so great and so nice, we felt like we were missing out.  This travesty dawned on us for a bit as we went on about existence.  Then we eventually just layed down and enjoyed looking up at the rain of color (leaves).  We took the yellow bouncy ball and threw it up into the sky and as it distanced from our hands it blended in each time with the assortment of the yellow until it came back down.  It seemed like it was all moving in slow motion.  \\r\\n\\nDuring this time we had smoked out of a one hitter about 3 or so times, which always brings on the visuals a little stronger and makes the trip even better.  We were also drinking down diet cokes, for some reason they taste amazing and the carbonation feels great in our mouths and going down into our bodies.  \\r\\n\\nWe later walked through campus and decided that we were both in the Jurassic park watching mood. For whatever reason she understood and was totally on the same page as me.  And then we started laughing wondering what about Jurassic park we liked, was it seeing people being torn up by dinosaurs?  We felt horrible about liking it, then we realized that it makes us feel better because while watching it we know no matter what happens, we will never be torn up by a dinosaur, then we decided that would be the worst death ever.\\r\\n\\nWe found a new spot on campus which was a little nook under a staircase with some really soft rocks.  And we talked about how weird it was.  Because someone actually made these rocks, theyre not naturally that smooth, and we found it odd that someones job is to make rocks smooth.  Then we noticed large gashes in some of the rocks laid together, and realized that the gashes had to have been made after they were laid there, and began to wonder, what exactly makes a gash in a rock?  Just normal random trippy talk.\\r\\n\\nThen we took out the music  again, commenced drawing.  Then all the sudden someone walks out of a door and smiles and says hi to us. He kinda laughed because Im sure we looked odd. The location on campus was really random and we were listening to beatles, drawing and it probably smelled like weed haha.  We loved that he had come into our world we felt like he was a part of it now, so we had to give him a name.  We decided he looked very elf like with his jolly beard, so we named him buddy the elf.   He came in and our of our fantasy land without even knowing it.  \\r\\n\\nWe caught a glimpse of the computers clock on accident by this time and saw that it was 4:30pm, this was the first trip that kind of felt time relative.  I think its mostly because the sun helped us, since its winter, at about 2 the sun begins to rapidly set, so it almost felt like time passed really fast, yet our experience felt like an eternity, so it kind of balanced out.  We talked about love, and The Beatles, and how there are so few men who think of such beautiful simple lyrics as they did, and how we wanted a man to think of us like that one day. \\r\\n\\nWe went to the restroom in shifts, since we had nice stuff with us, and had an entire little area set up.  And each time wed separate it was nice alone time, which I always need on a trip.  I went into the building to go to the restroom, Id never been in this building on campus, and it was AMAZING!  It was bright yellow and red and black inside, and very geometric and I was just walking through the quiet halls tripping on all the simple echoes and shapes and colors.  It just felt almost like I wasnt real, and this world wasnt real, and was all just a fantasy, and although I knew the experience partially was a fantasy, I knew this world was real.  I thought it was amazing.  \\r\\n\\nWe concluded the trip around 5:30pm we were almost completely done tripping by this point, just a little off mentally still.  We walked to get some food, went to my place played with my kitten, smoked and chilled and just drew the rest of the night.  \\r\\n\\nThe most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  The most that I gained from this trip was the whole idea of appreciation and new confidence.  I realized that I doubt myself a lot, especially my art.  This trip helped me understand that I just need to have more patience with my work and confidence in it.  I realized that I need to be more outgoing and confident with my decisions and just stop having so much doubt.\\r\\n\\nI gained the most about myself this trip which is another reason I think the experience is so important.  I think there are parts of myself and of the world that I will never completely understand.  I think our minds are almost too powerful to understand without the help of hallucinogenic to really open our minds and break down our thoughts a little slower than we normally would.  The details of life are beautiful, and mushrooms allow us to slow down and really take note, and appreciate them.  A quote from our trip its a crime that its a crime to do these things.  \\r\\n\\nWe discovered life, and the universe and how every day is a gift to us.  And how we need to stop worrying about what others think, and try and do more of what makes us truly happy.  Another plus of tripping, is we always learn more about each other, become closer, and take away memories and jokes forever.  I always tend to grow little closer with whoever I trip with.\\r\\n\\nWe laughed when we thought about ourselves sitting on a blanket drawing, listening to the beatles as a crime, we wanted to know who it was hurting.  We werent even hurting ourselves.  And while tripping we dont want to interact with others, so were definitely not interfering with anyone else. Its sad how close minded of a world weve come to live in.  But we wont let it get the best of us.  We still have our little escapes from reality.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "      &lt;td&gt;\\n&#x27;I met my true self for the first time aged 25&#x27;3 dried grams of Psilocybe Subaeruginosa (equivalent to 5 grams of Psilocybe Cubensis) while meditating in silent darkness. \\r\\n\\nLast night I decided to finally attempt the famous Terrence Mckenna &#x27;5 grams in silent darkness&#x27; trip for the first time. It would end up being by far the most intense trip of my life. Here is my story. \\r\\n\\nMy previous trip (about a month ago) was the first time I had ever tripped alone, and I spent the bulk of the trip in my silent bedroom with my eyes covered lying in bed, although this dosage was just 2.1 grams (equivalent to 3.3 grams of P. Cubensis). I also spent most of that trip writhing and wriggling in my bed, and getting up to go to the toilet three or so times. I found that trip to be a success, given I was able to get through it without any fear or anxietya feat which I had only been able to achieve for the first time earlier this year on an even lower dose. My goal for my next trip was to do the full 3 grams, and also, to see if I could keep my body perfectly still and relaxed throughout the trip. I got this idea from listening to interviews with Martin Ball, who in his experience in administering and guiding 5meo-dmt trips, says he has observed trippers twisting their bodies into asymmetrical positions when their ego is clinging on and resisting the break-through, and encouraged his clients to try to maintain a relaxed, symmetrical body position through the tripa kind of physical way to surrender to the experience, in addition to the mental surrendering which is so crucial. So, I had a goal to spend the entire trip lying on my back in my bed with my arms lying relaxed to the sides of my torso (I also got the idea from Martin Ball that having your arms covering your chest is a defensive, protective position, and so having the chest open and exposed is further conducive to the physical surrender). \\r\\n\\nSo, I gulped down my shroom tea in about 30 seconds, got into this relaxed position in bed, covered my eyes, and began to try to get into a meditative statenoticing my thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations and observing them as they arrived and left in waves (I believe this meditation technique is called Vipassana, and I have been practicing it infrequently for 3-4 months). The crucial part of this kind of meditation is to be committed to staying stillto resist the urges to move or get up that the mind constantly generates. I was able to maintain this still position for the first 2 and a half hours of the trip. \\r\\n\\nThe come-up was fast and extremely intense. The first feelings I noticed, about 10 minutes after drinking the tea, were waves of energy and pressure that suddenly swept through my body. The sensations were kind of like heat, or a physical pushing, and they quickly started to come more frequently and more intensely. Soon after this, my first visual perceptions began, accompanied by much stronger waves of the physical energy sweeping more and more rapidly and forcefully through my body. My visuals consisted of a range of solidly-coloured (subdued fluorescent pink, green, yellow, solid black and white), tessellated, geometric shapes, rotating, stretching and contorting amongst themselves, and corresponding with the waves of physical pressure and energy sweeping through my body. As this intensified, I had the sensation that these shapes were squashing, stretching, and twisting my body and head like a baker kneading dough. I also had the sense that I was lying on a kind of operating table, looking up at these kind of alien-esque shape-entities that were crushing my body and head, then passing me onto the next set of alien-esque shape-entities to do more contorting. Although this was a very intense experience, I knew I was safe, and so I surrendered to these shape-entities and let them do whatever they wanted to me. \\r\\n\\nThis period of the trip seemed to last about 30 minutes, and eventually the intense physical waves of energy seemed to subside and the speed and ferocity of my visuals subdued. This marked the start of the main body of the trip, which was marked by a range of feelings, revelations and experiences, the order of which is difficult to recall. The first main feeling I can recall was this sense that objectivity and subjectivity were not distinct anymore. I could not really identify as an entity or a being that was separate from anything external to me. It felt as if &#x27;being&#x27; was just this one phenomenon which encapsulated the entire gamut of possible experiencethat there was no difference between &#x27;me&#x27; and &#x27;not me&#x27;, between what &#x27;I did&#x27;, and what &#x27;happened to me&#x27;. My sense of agency was completely gone. The only thing I could be sure about was that something was happening. It was also quite extraordinary to comprehend that even in this incredible state, the &#x27;volume&#x27; or &#x27;intensity&#x27; of awareness or consciousness seemed the same as a regular sober state or the state on any kind of other drug I have experienced. There was basically the present momentwhich I was aware ofthe contents of which would evolve moment to moment, but which could never become &#x27;more full&#x27; or &#x27;more empty&#x27;. Even the lack of a feeling or sensation in a given moment was offset by space, which itself had the same &#x27;volume&#x27; as any sensation or feeling that might have been there. I interpret this now as the idea that consciousness is always complete. It never needs anything more, and never has too much. It is steady and eternal. Each moment is perfect and whole regardless of its contents. \\r\\n\\nThis experience led me to begin to questionwhat am I? My ideas that I have previously always had about who I am pretty much all depended on the idea that I was distinct from the external worldthat I was an entity that interacted with things that weren&#x27;t me (other people, objects etc.). Now, with the idea of my separateness from the world inaccessible, non-sensical, and incomprehensible, I had almost nothing to go off to answer my question. Who the hell am I!? \\r\\n\\nAll I could be sure of in this state, was that SOMETHING was happening. I was having thoughts, feelings, sensations, and visual and auditory perceptions. There was not &#x27;nothing&#x27;. Quite the opposite. There was &#x27;everything&#x27;, and I started to realise that there ALWAYS HAS BEEN everything. Every single experience, thought, emotion and feeling I have ever had, which now are only accessible to me in the form of memories, &#x27;I&#x27; had. That is to say, the only thing I can possibly be sure about is that they happened, and &#x27;I&#x27; experienced them. What a revelation! What &#x27;I&#x27; am, must be the very awareness or consciousness that has experienced and been witness to every single thing that has ever happened to me. I am not the &#x27;idea&#x27; I have about who I am (one might call this the ego). That &#x27;idea&#x27; is simply a pattern of thought that has been repeating for my entire life, and fooling me into believing in its existence and reality. What &#x27;I&#x27; ACTUALLY am, is an awareness, a consciousness, that has existed for eternity (as far as I can perceive, given I dont remember the start of my existence), which has been the witness to my thoughts, feelings, and sense-perceptions for my entire life. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my &#x27;idea&#x27; of who I am, doesnt really exist. How have I never realised this until now!! It became suddenly very clear to me that my ego, or my &#x27;idea&#x27; of who I am, doesnt really exist. I found out who I truly am, for the first time in my life. \\r\\n\\nAfter this incredible realisation, a lot of tension became released from my body that I didn&#x27;t notice I was holding. I had just come face to face with my actual, true selfmy pure consciousness. I had finally broken through my mind, which had been preventing me from encountering my pure essence for my whole life. Suddenly, my experience became very soft and delicate. I had let down every single guard from my pure being and exposed my self to itself for the first time ever. It was so fragile and vulnerable. It was very cautious of letting me get close to itafraid of what might happen to it now that it had no protection whatsoever. My body had become extremely relaxed and utterly limp, perhaps it had lost tension that it had been holding onto for years, even decades. I saw my pure, vulnerable, exposed selfso shy and nervous. I realised what a profound moment this was. I was meeting my true self for the first time. I felt an immense care and love for my shy, vulnerable self. All it wanted was to love, and to be loved, and I loved it. I approached it very slowly so I could get closer to it without scaring it. I began to touch it, lovingly, caringly, slowly, making sure that it was feeling safe and comfortable with the amount of contact, which was more than had ever been made. It was a very similar experience to the most loving and caring kind of love-making, where two people are completely engaged and completely present with each other, and every move each one makes is determined by how the other receives and accepts it. My pure self was letting me meet it, letting me into its most vulnerable space, and accepting me! It embraced me. I had earned its trust, and I was able to get closer to it than anyone had ever gotten. I effectively met my self, and made love with it. It was possibly the most beautiful and powerful experience of life. \\r\\n\\nI opened my eyes and wriggled my fingers and toes around this point, and took in some deep, euphoric breaths as I reconnected to my surroundings. This was probably about 2 and half hours after consumption, and I was seeing a quadrupled kaleidoscope of my ceilingsome of the heaviest open-eye visuals I have ever had, which seemed to be a predictable level considering the profundity of what I had just experienced. I lay for a while watching the ceiling with my arms out like a starfish, breathing deeply, basking in the beauty and glory of my existence and what had just happened to me. A phrase came to my mind and I couldn&#x27;t stop repeating it. &#x27;You are your home&#x27;. What this meant to me was that no matter where you are physically, and whomever you are with, you are ALWAYS with your self. Your self is your home. You should love your self, you should get to know your self, because it is the only thing that has always been with you and always will be. To not know your self is to live a life of distraction and illusion, and to not care for and love your self is to harm your selfto disrespect your only home, your eternal home. I got out of bed and wrote on a piece of paper so I wouldn&#x27;t forget these messages&#x27;You are your home&#x27;, and beneath, &#x27;YOU have been here through everything that has ever happened to you.&#x27; The second phrase I very carefully crafted to try to embody the insight I had about what my true self is in a way that I could interpret in a sober state. I intended it to cut through the &#x27;idea of my self&#x27; (the ego) which my mind continually perpetuates, which changes and evolves in content and quality over time, in contrast to my true self (my pure consciousness/awareness), which is always steady and whole, and always has been, despite my inability to recognize it for my whole life. With the bulk of the trip over, I rode out the final couple of hours of the come-down listening to music with my housemate. \\r\\n\\nThis experience has been an enormous milestone in my personal journey, and has lent credence to many inklings I have been having since I began paying closer attention to the contents of my mind about a year ago. I never really understood how one can have a relationship with oneself so viscerally until now, and I have a renewed sense of awe for my life.&lt;/td&gt;\n",

       "6    \\nBACKGROUND:\\r\\nThe summer after my freshman year I bought a mushroom kit from a local head shop with the intention of taking it home and doing mushrooms all summer long.  I had previously tripped on low dosages (one 2.5 gram trip, one 1 gram trip, one 4 gram trip) of mushrooms earlier in the year.  These trips amounted to nothing more than a few breathing walls, small visual distortions, and very stoned thoughts.\\r\\n\\nMindset:\\r\\nFastforward to mid-summer.  The mushrooms took a very long time to grow, something like a month and a half.  No complaints really, since it was a kit that required little to no attention or preparation, just a little anxious to do my mushrooms since my summer was already half gone.  Due to the unforseen growing time of the shrooms I had decided to do a large dose at once.  I knew I had to plan my trip carefully knowing this.  Before dropping the shrooms I drilled it in to my brain that it was going to be a good trip and that all variables within my control had been carefully scrutinized and that there was no need to go to my friends, parents, or authorities for anything.  No need to leave my room.\\r\\n\\nSetting:\\r\\nLate night/Early morning  1 am,  My room.  I had put every pillow and blanket I could scrounge into my closest to create a super comfortable cocoon.  \\r\\n\\nMy Trip:\\r\\nThis is written in the chronological order that I experienced.\\r\\n\\n1am - I had originally decided to do 7 grams, a dosage a college friend recommended.  I dropped the mushrooms one by one, some fresh, some dried.  After reaching the seven gram target I weighed out the remainder of mushrooms, 6 grams.  And on an impulse I just shoved the 6 grams in to my mouth.  After a little mental math 6+7=13 I began to panic at the sheer dosage I had done.  Thoughs began to fill my mind that my dad would come up stairs open my door and find me all tripped out in my closet, the panic began to crecendo.  At that moment I reminded myself of the careful planning that went into this endevour; that was the last unpleasent feeling of the night.\\r\\n\\n115am - I turn on the black light in my room shut the closet door and turn of the lights. Complete sensory deprivation. I spend the next few minutes lying in my cocoon just having run of the mill sober thoughts. \\r\\n\\n120am - Nothing yet.  I turn my head to the left and feel my stomach churn.  I close my eyes and extrodanary patterns of colors and geometric shapes suddenly hit me.  I am tripping, hard.  I am paying a lot of attention to the visuals they are quite like nothing I had ever seen, magnificent geometric and fractal patterns.  I see intensifiying patterns for the next 10 minutes, I am quite lucid for a while.  I turn my head forward again and the geometric patterns are quite strong.\\r\\n\\n145am - I have reached a plateau and am quite sure that this is the peak of my trip.  But then this strange visual static, a little like TV Snow, only a little though, it's truly indescribable, starts to appear behind the colorful patterns.  It slowly starts overcoming the patterns, and now the patterns are coming in and out of the static quite like a fading radio station.  I suddenly realize that I am in for much more than I had originally thought.  Soon the geometric patterns and colors are gone and not to bee seen again, only the static remains.  I can feel myself losing grasp of reality, I am not lucid like I was just moments earlier, I am sprialing down into the psychadelic abyss.\\r\\n\\nFlurries of pictures begin to flash in front of me, pictures I haven't seen since childhood.  Feelings I haven't felt since childhood begin to flow through me.  My child hood mindset had actually taken hold of me.  I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that I was no longer 19 years old.  I was 7.  All the memories were clear, as if I was reliving them, actually there.  I opened my eyes and saw a faint light coming from a door shining light on the complete darkness that was a familiar room.  I understood this vision to be from my past when I was newly born, lying in my crib in my parents room.  It felt real, not imagined or dreamt.\\r\\n\\nAt that point the room disappeared and only the distant light was visible.  My cocoon began to feel warm and wet, it felt as if it encompassed my entire body.  The light faded and I felt my eyes begin to wander around the compete darkness, they were no longer in sync.  Each eye was going in its own direction and focusing and defocusing, they had minds of their own.  My fingers began to move on their own accord, I had absolutely no control over their movement.\\r\\n\\n2am - 15 minutes have passed and I have alredy re-experienced my birth.  I was crying at the sheer beauty of life and it's creation.  I bawled for the next 15 minutes.  \\r\\n\\n215am - I had gone insane.  I had taken a small analog watch with glowing hands to keep track of time in the complete darkness, and at exactly 2:16 I snapped.  This was the last time during the trip that time had any meaning or even existed.  For the past hour I had been steadily losing grasp of reality but nothing prepared me from this sudden meltdown of my mind. I abruptly stopped crying.  At the moment I didn't not think I was insane, but I was.  It was as if my mind had been struggling to break loose of it's confines for the last hour and had finally made it to the other side.  Nothing mattered anymore, I was inhabting the 4th dimension.  I was living all parts of my life at once.  Time broke down completely.  All the thoughts I had ever had in my entire life were suddenly present at the front of my mind, and there was room for all of it.\\r\\n\\nI even recognized thoughts and memories that I hadn't even lived through yet, thoughts of my wife and children, my work, my success, the tribulations of being in my 40s with a family!  I'M ONLY 19. It didn't matter though, I had transcended time, it was all relevent.  I also had this strange ability to recall every dream I had ever had, with this ability I could recall dreams and explore their landscapes as I never could before, like they were real places.  I had my eyes open this entire time, the sensory deprivation really got to me, I projected my thoughts on to my eyes, and explored my dream worlds in great detail walking, running, feeling things, touching things, talking with people.\\r\\n\\nThe dreams and the reliving of my life were simultaneous and seem to take eternities.  The entire time I had this feeling of peace and beauty, as if I had lived my life entirely and was ready to die.  All feelings became one, joy and suffering were indestinguishable from eachother, all feelings joined together to create an innerpeace telling me everything is ...going/going to be/has already been... alright.  I wonder if I'm going to stay this way forever.\\r\\n\\n2somethingA.M. - Everything becomes too much for me to handle, and I decide to leave the sensory deprivation closet. I open the door.  To my great suprise I had forgotten about the black light so everything looks extremely different and slightly frightening.  There is this weird three dimensional script all over the floor of my room.  Everything is spinning and moving and breathing and waving.  I look at the clock but it makes no sense.  It says 2:15am.  I make no attempt to reconcille the fact that everything I had experienced in the closet since last looking at my watch (which seemingly took an indescribably long time) had taken no time at all.\\r\\n\\nI look away from the clock and begin to contemplate the time I had 'just spent' in the bathroom, I glance at the clock and it says 3:15, I look away again and ask myself how an hour just pass in a few seconds.  I look back at the clock and it says 2:45, and I go to the bathroom.  While in the bathroom I realize that time was skipping back and forth, and that I was experiencing things before they happen and then doing them.  This is a most strange feeling.  I look at myself in the mirror and I morph in to an old man (which is what I was contemplating earlier before it even happened!).  The old version of myself was unsettling.  \\r\\n\\n315am - I get bored of looking at the future me.  I leave the bathroom and contemplate the time I had 'just spent' in there.  I glance at the clock, 3:15am, it means nothing to me.  I lay down in my bed and begin 3 hours of intense introspective travel until I fall asleep.\\r\\n\\nConclusions:\\r\\nIt has taken me weeks to recover from this one trip.  I still don't fully understand it.  Especially the time aspect.  In the morning I looked at both my room clock and the watch I had used in the closet and both were telling the same time.  I truly felt as if I inhabited a dimension where time has no meaning when past, present, and future are all the same.  I also beleive the mind stores everything that it experiences, absolutely everyting, and that somehow psychadelics are the gateway in which we tap our unused parts of the brain, unlocking realms of existance that only the divine are said to inhabit.\n",

       "47    i came into possession of an eighth of mushrooms  they were a bit overpriced but due to the rarity of these magical fungi i was more than willing to pay  this would be my first time tripping and i was more than a little excited to finally experience the notorious journey i had heard so much about    we had been planning on going camping with some other friends who also were going to be tripping that night  but as fate would have it we ended up going to another friend s house who had an open house for the weekend  the setting was a large house in a small town neighborhood  my friend who owned the house  charley  was having several people over who planned on drinking and having a high ole time  my fellow tripping friend  we ll call him gary  and i ingested the mushrooms around     pm  i decided to take only half an     but my buddy munched the whole godamned thing  i expected to have a mild trip due to the smaller amount ingested  directly after eating them we smoked a bowl and sat down in the living room to wait for the initial effects  i began to feel cramped and claustrophobic in the rather large room  a feeling of anxiety clawed at the pit of my stomach    i stood up and suggested to gary that we should take that walk in the woods  the cool evening air felt great and the open space was very suething  as we walked along the sidewalk i noticed a colorful spiraled shell pattern on the side of a stone wall  as we continued on to the woods  i had a bizzare feeling of walking sideways  like i was walking along a very steep hill  some people were playing basketball across the street and i felt as if they knew i was tripping and i began to have strange thoughts  i almost felt as if i was in a disney cartoon and could break out it a corny song any second  with bluebirds chirping and all  we got to the woods  gary had at this point no clue where we were  and was sweating profusely with a very freaked out look on his face  we made it to the woods safely  but i began bugging out and called charly to come pick us up  we waited for several minutes and they arrived with some random people i didn t know in the car  they were carrying on a conversation about something or other  but interpreting social interactions had become uncomfortable although i tried to seem at least partially aware of what was happening by uttering forced laughs at things that the others were laughing at    we arrived back at charly s house and an overwhelming feeling of anxiety began to cramp my brain  i was pacing back in forth in the kitchen wondering why i would ever have wanted to trip in the first place  i gave the remaining shrooms to charley and told him to keep them safe for me  i then pleaded with him to remind me never to eat mushrooms again  i retrieved a coke from the fridge and went and sat down with the rest of the people in the living room  everything was just to much  to overwhelming  i wasn t having any visuals yet  but charly s friends words began to sound like complete jibberish  this insanity was really freaking me out  so i grabbed gary and when went and got some fresh air on the back porch    gary at that point had lost all touch of reality and had no idea of who or where he was  i lay down on my back on the porch and tried to think straight  i kept telling myself i would be fine in a couple hours and was just tripping on some mushrooms  but time had lost all meaning  the open sky began to have a negative sinister feel to it so i rushed back into the house and plopped down on the couch  i began to feel uncomfortably hot and took off my shirt  the room had begun to pulsate with green and red colors  and charly s face started melting into itself  i could only think of how bad i wanted it to stop  but it just kept becoming more intense    i asked charly with much difficulty to put on some acid rock  he played some jimmy hendrix and led zepplin  i began to relax and enjoy the trip as jimmy s guitar overpowered my senses  the notes created intensely colorful visuals that would shift and morph with the music  i began the journey into my subconceince  i lay on the couch realizing just how amazingly big my mind was  i saw myself as a black and green dragon  constantly morphing into different shapes and dimensions  i realized i was a strong person and could make it through anything  this realization was a huge relief and i stopped fighting the trip and just let go  i left my body and my ego was washed away by the light  a giant stone sungod entity hovered over my head  it took me under it s wing and as if to protect me from all negativity  it was a female entity  i don t know how i knew this but i just knew  i flowed with the universe  the universe  time  and space all flowed as one  it was the most beautiful feeling  everything was in perfect harmony  there was no  i     after this feeling of intense euphoria i began to contemplate my life  i could feel my hands and only my hands and they were small blue mushroom huts  where my family lived  i realised that the purpose in this uncomprehendibly short life of ours was to find a soul mate  i realized that material possessions meant nothing and a person s soul is all that matters  i thought of my family and i saw all of us together floating as four blue bumps in a black void  each of the bumps was the entity of my family  and we were connected in a different dimension  it s very hard to explain but realizing this felt like a great weight was lifted from my shoulders    after journeying through many more amazing dimensions and realizing many more of life s questions  sadly i can t recall  i began to drift back to reality and the room in which my physical body was located in  i opened my eyes and began looking around the room  i asked charly what time it was       pm  only   hours      it had felt like a lifetime  i began looking around the room  everything was morphing into rediculous shapes  there was a couch in the room with a interflowing flower pattern on it  all the flowers began to flow into each other  this couch was giving off an awful vibe and began to wig me out  i began to look around the room and noticed that a girl i had never met was sitting at the computer  several more girls showed up and attempted to have a friendly conversation with me  i could give no more than one word replies and the conversation soon died to silence    an awfully awkward vibe filled the room and my trip started to go sour again  i began to look around the room and greatly enjoyed the amazing colors radiating off all of the morphing objects in the room  everything was morphing so fast it was all to much for my mind to comprehend  a small blue half moon appeared on the lower right side of my vision and began spinning around hectacly  some more people showed up with the movie grandmas boy  i moved to a different seat and tried to watch the show  i couldn t concentrate on anything more than   seconds so none of it made any sense to me  i watched in bewilderment as david spade s face folded in on itself    i began to come down and the visuals began to become less intence  i began comprehend time again and social interactions became much more fluient  gary was just comming back from his journey as well  we looked at each other and a feeling of joy poured through my body  we made it  i thought  we then went out onto the back porch and chilled under the stars smoking cigarrette after ciggarette  i wasn t so much smoking them as just staring at them with a childlike wonder  i looked into the trees and the branches began to form words  another hour passed and i felt pretty much back to baseline  but a bit fried  i went and lay down and had a relatively easy time falling asleep \n",
